Please pay attention to SecurityException.
You're right, we should handle the `SecurityException` that can be thrown if the application doesn't have permission to access the directory. Here's an updated version of the code that handles the exception:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

public class DirectoryLastModifiedTime {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File directory = new File("path/to/directory");
        try {
            Date lastModified = new Date(directory.lastModified());
            SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss");
            System.out.println("Last modified time of directory: " + dateFormat.format(lastModified));
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.err.println("SecurityException: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

We've added a `try-catch` block around the code that accesses the directory's last modified time. If a `SecurityException` is thrown, we catch it and print an error message to the console. This way, the application won't crash if it doesn't have permission to access the directory.
