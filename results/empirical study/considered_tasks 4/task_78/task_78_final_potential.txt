Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static <T> T[] collectionToArray(Collection<T> collection) throws NullPointerException {
    if (collection == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Collection cannot be null");
    }
    T[] array = (T[]) new Object[collection.size()];
    int i = 0;
    for (T item : collection) {
        array[i++] = item;
    }
    return array;
}
```

In this version, we've added a check to ensure that the collection is not null. If it is null, we throw a NullPointerException with a descriptive message. This helps to catch potential issues early on and provide useful feedback to the caller.

Note that we're still using unchecked casting to create the new array, so the same caveat applies as before.
