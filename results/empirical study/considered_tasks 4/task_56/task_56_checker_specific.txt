List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only fully qualified name with parameters, no other text. Parameters types must be fully qualified, exclude the parameter names. Display in a list. Each fully qualified name should be enclosed in a backticks (`)
Here are the fully qualified names of the Java JDK methods used in the method above:

- `java.io.File.createTempFile(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)`
- `java.io.File.getAbsolutePath()`

 + From response, we get: ['java.io.File.createTempFile(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)', 'java.io.File.getAbsolutePath()']

Is the IllegalArgumentException handled or caught for java.io.File.createTempFile(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `IllegalArgumentException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.File.createTempFile(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes, the `IOException` is handled or caught in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature with the `throws` keyword, which means that any `IOException` thrown by the `File.createTempFile()` method will be propagated up to the calling method to be handled or caught there.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SecurityException handled or caught for java.io.File.createTempFile(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `SecurityException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. If a `SecurityException` is thrown by the `File.createTempFile()` method, it will be propagated up to the calling method to be handled or caught there.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SecurityException handled or caught for java.io.File.getAbsolutePath() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `SecurityException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. If a `SecurityException` is thrown by the `File.getAbsolutePath()` method, it will be propagated up to the calling method to be handled or caught there. However, it is unlikely that a `SecurityException` will be thrown by this method.
