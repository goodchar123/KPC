Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files. Here's an updated version of the code that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.util.Date;

public class FileLastModifiedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("path/to/file.txt");
        try {
            Date lastModified = new Date(file.lastModified());
            System.out.println("Last modified date: " + lastModified);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error getting last modified date: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we wrap the call to `lastModified()` in a try-catch block. If an exception is thrown, we catch it and print out an error message. This helps to prevent the program from crashing if there is an issue with the file.
