Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a `SecurityException` when accessing the system property value:

```java
public static boolean compareFilePaths(File file1, File file2) throws SecurityException {
    String path1 = null;
    String path2 = null;
    try {
        path1 = file1.getAbsolutePath();
        path2 = file2.getAbsolutePath();
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Cannot access system property value for file path.");
    }
    return path1.equals(path2);
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch any `SecurityException` that may occur when accessing the system property value for the file path. If a `SecurityException` is caught, the method throws a new `SecurityException` with a custom message. Otherwise, the method proceeds to compare the file paths as before.
