Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static boolean compareFilePaths(File file1, File file2) {
    try {
        String path1 = file1.getCanonicalPath();
        String path2 = file2.getCanonicalPath();
        return path1.equals(path2);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle the exception here, e.g. log it or throw a custom exception
        return false;
    }
}
```

In this version, we use the `getCanonicalPath()` method instead of `getAbsolutePath()`. This method returns the canonical path of the file, which is the unique, absolute path that does not contain any symbolic links or redundant elements. This can help avoid false positives when comparing file paths.

We also wrap the method body in a try-catch block to handle any `IOException` that may be thrown if there is an error resolving the canonical path. In this case, we return `false` to indicate that the paths are not equal. You could also choose to log the exception or throw a custom exception instead.
