Please pay attention to PatternSyntaxException.
You're right, it's important to handle the `PatternSyntaxException` that can be thrown if the regular expression pattern is invalid. Here's an updated version of the method that includes a try-catch block to handle this exception:

```java
public static boolean isValidEmail(String email) {
    String emailRegex = "^[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+(?:\\." +
                        "[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+)*@" +
                        "(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.)+[a-z" +
                        "A-Z]{2,7}$";
    try {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(emailRegex);
        return pattern.matcher(email).matches();
    } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
        // handle the exception
        System.err.println("Invalid regular expression pattern: " + e.getMessage());
        return false;
    }
}
```

In this version of the method, we wrap the regular expression pattern compilation and matching in a try-catch block. If a `PatternSyntaxException` is thrown, we catch it and print an error message to the console. We also return `false` to indicate that the email address is not valid, since we can't match it against an invalid regular expression pattern.
