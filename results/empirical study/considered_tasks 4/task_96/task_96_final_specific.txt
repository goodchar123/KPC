Please pay attention to IOException, SocketTimeoutException.
You're right, it's important to handle exceptions properly in order to make the code more robust. Here's an updated version of the `getFileSize` method that handles `IOException` and `SocketTimeoutException`:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.SocketTimeoutException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLConnection;

public class FileSizeGetter {
    public static long getFileSize(String fileUrl) throws IOException, SocketTimeoutException {
        URL url = new URL(fileUrl);
        URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
        conn.setConnectTimeout(5000); // set connection timeout to 5 seconds
        conn.setReadTimeout(5000); // set read timeout to 5 seconds
        conn.connect();
        return conn.getContentLengthLong();
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added two lines to set the connection and read timeouts to 5 seconds. This means that if the server doesn't respond within 5 seconds, a `SocketTimeoutException` will be thrown. We've also updated the method signature to declare that it throws `IOException` and `SocketTimeoutException`.

When calling this method, you should handle these exceptions appropriately. Here's an example:

```java
String fileUrl = "http://example.com/file.txt";
try {
    long fileSize = FileSizeGetter.getFileSize(fileUrl);
    System.out.println("File size: " + fileSize + " bytes");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("Error connecting to server: " + e.getMessage());
} catch (SocketTimeoutException e) {
    System.err.println("Timeout connecting to server: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

In this example, we've wrapped the call to `getFileSize` in a try-catch block. If an `IOException` is thrown, we print an error message indicating that there was a problem connecting to the server. If a `SocketTimeoutException` is thrown, we print an error message indicating that the connection timed out.
