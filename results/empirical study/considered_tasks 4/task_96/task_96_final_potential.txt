Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when retrieving the file size from a server. Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLConnection;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileSizeGetter {
    public static long getFileSize(String fileUrl) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL(fileUrl);
            URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
            conn.connect();
            return conn.getContentLengthLong();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error retrieving file size: " + e.getMessage());
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that might be thrown when connecting to the server or retrieving the file size. If an exception is caught, we print an error message to the console and return `-1` to indicate that an error occurred.

You can call this method like this:

```java
String fileUrl = "http://example.com/file.txt";
long fileSize = FileSizeGetter.getFileSize(fileUrl);
if (fileSize != -1) {
    System.out.println("File size: " + fileSize + " bytes");
}
```

In this example, we check if the file size is `-1` before printing it to the console. If the file size is `-1`, it means an error occurred and we don't print anything.
