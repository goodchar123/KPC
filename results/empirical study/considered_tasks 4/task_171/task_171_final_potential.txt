Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with linked lists. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static <T> void getFirstAndLast(LinkedList<T> list) {
    try {
        T first = list.getFirst();
        T last = list.getLast();
        System.out.println("First element: " + first);
        System.out.println("Last element: " + last);
    } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
        System.out.println("The list is empty.");
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block to handle the `NoSuchElementException` that can occur if the list is empty. If this exception is caught, we simply print out a message indicating that the list is empty.
