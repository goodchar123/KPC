Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in the code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static Date addTimeToDate(Date date, int days, int years, int seconds) {
    try {
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
        calendar.setTime(date);
        calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR, days);
        calendar.add(Calendar.YEAR, years);
        calendar.add(Calendar.SECOND, seconds);
        return calendar.getTime();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Error adding time to date: " + e.getMessage());
        return null;
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block around the code that adds time to the date. If an exception is thrown, we catch it and print an error message to the console. We also return null instead of a Date object, since the operation failed.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Date myDate = new Date();
Date newDate = addTimeToDate(myDate, 10, 2, 30);
if (newDate != null) {
    // do something with newDate
} else {
    // handle the error
}
```

In this example, we check if the returned Date object is null before using it, since it may not have been created if an exception was thrown.
