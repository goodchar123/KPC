Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileRenamer {
    public static void renameFile(String oldFilePath, String newFilePath) {
        File oldFile = new File(oldFilePath);
        File newFile = new File(newFilePath);
        try {
            if (oldFile.renameTo(newFile)) {
                System.out.println("File renamed successfully");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Failed to rename file");
            }
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.out.println("Security exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("Null pointer exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block around the `renameTo()` method call. We've also added specific catch blocks for `SecurityException` and `NullPointerException`, which are two common exceptions that can occur when working with files. Finally, we've added a catch-all `Exception` block to handle any other exceptions that might occur. In each catch block, we print an error message that includes the exception message.
