Please pay attention to NullPointerException, SecurityException.
You're right, it's important to handle exceptions properly in any code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileRenamer {
    public static void renameFile(String oldFilePath, String newFilePath) {
        try {
            File oldFile = new File(oldFilePath);
            File newFile = new File(newFilePath);
            if (oldFile.renameTo(newFile)) {
                System.out.println("File renamed successfully");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Failed to rename file");
            }
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: file path is null");
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: security exception occurred");
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block to handle two specific exceptions that might occur: `NullPointerException` and `SecurityException`. If either of these exceptions is thrown, the method will catch it and print an error message to the console. This helps ensure that the program doesn't crash unexpectedly if something goes wrong.
