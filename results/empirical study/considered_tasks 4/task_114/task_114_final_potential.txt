Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle exceptions properly. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static void sleep(long milliseconds) {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        System.err.println("Thread interrupted while sleeping: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this version, if the thread is interrupted while sleeping, the method calls `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()` to set the interrupted flag on the thread. It also prints an error message to the console to indicate that the thread was interrupted. This way, the calling code can check the interrupted flag and take appropriate action if necessary.
