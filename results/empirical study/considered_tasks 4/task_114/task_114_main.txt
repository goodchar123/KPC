Please write a java method that stop a thread for a while in Java
Sure, here's an example Java method that stops a thread for a specified amount of time:

```java
public static void sleep(long milliseconds) {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Handle the exception if needed
    }
}
```

This method takes a long value representing the number of milliseconds to pause the thread for. It then calls the `Thread.sleep()` method, which causes the current thread to sleep for the specified number of milliseconds. If the thread is interrupted while sleeping, the method catches the `InterruptedException` and handles it as needed.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the value of millis is negative for java.lang.Thread.sleep(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks if the value of `milliseconds` is negative and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is:

```java
public static void sleep(long milliseconds) {
    if (milliseconds < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Sleep time cannot be negative");
    }
    try {
        Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Handle the exception if needed
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the value of `milliseconds` is negative. If it is, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the sleep time cannot be negative. If the value is non-negative, the method proceeds to call `Thread.sleep()` as before.
