Please pay attention to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
You're right, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` can occur if the `key` is not found in the vector and the while loop exits with `low` greater than `high`. In that case, the next line `return -1;` will try to access an index of `-1` in the vector, which will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

To avoid this, we can add a check before returning `-1` to make sure that `low` is still less than or equal to `vector.size() - 1`. Here's the updated code:

```
public static int binarySearch(Vector<Integer> vector, int key) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = vector.size() - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        int midVal = vector.get(mid);

        if (midVal < key) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else if (midVal > key) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            return mid; // key found
        }
    }

    if (low <= vector.size() - 1) {
        return -1; // key not found
    } else {
        throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Key not found in vector");
    }
}
```

Now, if `low` is still less than or equal to `vector.size() - 1`, it returns `-1` as before. Otherwise, it throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` with a message indicating that the `key` was not found in the vector.

Please pay attention to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
You're right, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is an important exception to handle when performing binary search on an array. Here's an updated example Java method that performs binary search on an array and handles this exception:

```
public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int key) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.length - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;

        try {
            if (arr[mid] < key) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else if (arr[mid] > key) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                return mid; // key found
            }
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            // handle exception by returning -1
            return -1;
        }
    }

    return -1; // key not found
}
```

This method takes in an `int` array `arr` and an `int` key to search for. It initializes `low` and `high` variables to the first and last indices of the array, respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Inside the loop, it calculates the `mid` index as the average of `low` and `high`. It then retrieves the value at the `mid` index using the `[]` operator.

If the value at `arr[mid]` is less than the `key`, it means that the `key` must be in the upper half of the array, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`. If the value at `arr[mid]` is greater than the `key`, it means that the `key` must be in the lower half of the array, so it updates `high` to `mid - 1`. If the value at `arr[mid]` is equal to the `key`, it means that the `key` has been found, so it returns the `mid` index.

If an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown while accessing `arr[mid]`, it means that `mid` is out of bounds of the array. In this case, the method handles the exception by returning `-1`.

If the while loop completes without finding the `key`, it means that the `key` is not in the array, so it returns `-1`.
