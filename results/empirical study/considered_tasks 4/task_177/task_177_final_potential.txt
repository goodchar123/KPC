Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in the code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```
public static int binarySearch(Vector<Integer> vector, int key) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = vector.size() - 1;

    try {
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            int midVal = vector.get(mid);

            if (midVal < key) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else if (midVal > key) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                return mid; // key found
            }
        }
    } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        return -1;
    }

    return -1; // key not found
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block around the while loop to catch any `IndexOutOfBoundsException` that might occur if the `mid` index is out of bounds of the vector. If an exception is caught, we print an error message and return `-1` to indicate that the key was not found.

It's also worth noting that the `Vector` class is synchronized, which can lead to performance issues in some cases. If performance is a concern, it might be better to use an unsynchronized `ArrayList` instead.
