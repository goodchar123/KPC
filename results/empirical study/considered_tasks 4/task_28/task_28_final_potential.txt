Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in our code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static void findCommonElements(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
    try {
        Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<Integer>();
        Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<Integer>();
        for (int i : arr1) {
            set1.add(i);
        }
        for (int i : arr2) {
            set2.add(i);
        }
        set1.retainAll(set2);
        System.out.println("Common elements: " + set1);
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        System.out.println("One or both arrays are null.");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to handle potential exceptions. Specifically, we're catching a `NullPointerException` in case one or both of the arrays are null, and a generic `Exception` in case any other unexpected error occurs. In both cases, we're printing out an error message to help diagnose the issue.
