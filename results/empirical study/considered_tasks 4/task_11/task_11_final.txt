Sure, here's an updated version of the `formatString` method that checks for formatting errors and throws an `IllegalFormatException` if any are found:

```java
public static String formatString(String format, Object... args) throws IllegalFormatException {
    try {
        return String.format(format, args);
    } catch (IllegalFormatException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `IllegalFormatException` that is thrown by the `String.format()` method. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown to the calling method.

Note that this method only checks for formatting errors related to the `String.format()` method itself. It does not check for errors related to the format string syntax or the compatibility of the format specifiers with the given arguments. These types of errors are checked by the `String.format()` method itself and will be thrown as `IllegalFormatExceptions` if they occur.
