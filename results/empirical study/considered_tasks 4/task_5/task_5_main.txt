Please write a java method that search a word inside a string in Java
Sure, here's an example Java method that searches for a word inside a string:

```
public static boolean searchWord(String str, String word) {
    // Split the string into an array of words
    String[] words = str.split(" ");
    
    // Loop through each word in the array
    for (String w : words) {
        // If the word matches the search word, return true
        if (w.equals(word)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    // If the search word was not found, return false
    return false;
}
```

To use this method, you would pass in the string you want to search and the word you are looking for. For example:

```
String str = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
String word = "fox";

if (searchWord(str, word)) {
    System.out.println("The word " + word + " was found in the string.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The word " + word + " was not found in the string.");
}
```

This would output "The word fox was found in the string."

Please check if the regular expression's syntax is invalid for java.lang.String.split(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw PatternSyntaxException.
Sure, here's the updated code that checks for invalid regular expression syntax and throws a `PatternSyntaxException` if necessary:

```
import java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException;

public static boolean searchWord(String str, String word) throws PatternSyntaxException {
    // Check for invalid regular expression syntax
    try {
        str.split(word);
    } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
        throw new PatternSyntaxException("Invalid regular expression syntax", e.getPattern(), e.getIndex());
    }
    
    // Split the string into an array of words
    String[] words = str.split(" ");
    
    // Loop through each word in the array
    for (String w : words) {
        // If the word matches the search word, return true
        if (w.equals(word)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    // If the search word was not found, return false
    return false;
}
```

This code uses a try-catch block to check for invalid regular expression syntax when calling `str.split(word)`. If an exception is thrown, it is caught and a new `PatternSyntaxException` is thrown with a more descriptive error message.
