Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in our code. Here's an updated version of the `searchWord` method that includes exception handling:

```
public static boolean searchWord(String str, String word) {
    try {
        // Split the string into an array of words
        String[] words = str.split(" ");

        // Loop through each word in the array
        for (String w : words) {
            // If the word matches the search word, return true
            if (w.equals(word)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        // Handle the case where the input string is null
        System.out.println("Error: Input string is null.");
    }

    // If the search word was not found or an exception occurred, return false
    return false;
}
```

In this updated version, we've added a try-catch block to handle the case where the input string is null. If a `NullPointerException` is thrown, we catch it and print an error message to the console.

Of course, there may be other exceptions that could be thrown in this method depending on the specific implementation. It's important to identify potential exceptions and handle them appropriately to ensure our code is robust and reliable.
