Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when using the `Thread.sleep()` method. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static void sleepThread(long milliseconds) {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Restore interrupted status
        System.err.println("Thread sleep interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this version, we catch the `InterruptedException` that can be thrown by the `Thread.sleep()` method and restore the interrupted status of the thread by calling `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`. We also print an error message to the console to indicate that the sleep was interrupted.

By handling the exception in this way, we ensure that the thread's interrupted status is properly maintained and that any other code that relies on this status will behave correctly.
