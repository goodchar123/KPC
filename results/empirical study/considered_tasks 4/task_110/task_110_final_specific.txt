Please pay attention to SecurityException.
You're right, we should handle the `SecurityException` that can be thrown by the `Thread.enumerate()` method. Here's an updated version of the method that includes a try-catch block to handle the exception:

```
public static void getThreadPriorities() {
    try {
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[Thread.activeCount()];
        Thread.enumerate(threads);
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            if (thread != null) {
                System.out.println("Thread name: " + thread.getName() + ", priority: " + thread.getPriority());
            }
        }
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        System.err.println("Unable to get thread priorities: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this version, we wrap the `Thread.enumerate()` method call in a try-catch block that catches the `SecurityException` that can be thrown if the current thread doesn't have permission to access the thread group information. If the exception is caught, we print an error message to the console.
