Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in Java code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```
public static void getThreadPriorities() {
    try {
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[Thread.activeCount()];
        Thread.enumerate(threads);
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            if (thread != null) {
                System.out.println("Thread name: " + thread.getName() + ", priority: " + thread.getPriority());
            }
        }
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        System.err.println("SecurityException occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to catch the `SecurityException` that can be thrown by the `Thread.enumerate()` method if the current thread doesn't have permission to access all threads in the system. If this exception occurs, we print an error message to the console.
