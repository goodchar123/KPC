Yes, that's correct. The `ThreadGroup.enumerate(Thread[])` method requires the current thread to have permission to access the thread group. If the current thread does not have permission, the `ThreadGroup.checkAccess()` method will throw a `SecurityException`.

Here's an updated version of the `getThreadPriorities()` method that includes the `ThreadGroup.checkAccess()` method to ensure that the current thread has permission to access its thread group:

```
public static void getThreadPriorities() {
    ThreadGroup currentGroup = Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup();
    int noThreads = currentGroup.activeCount();
    Thread[] threads = new Thread[noThreads];
    currentGroup.enumerate(threads);
    for (Thread thread : threads) {
        if (thread != null) {
            System.out.println("Thread name: " + thread.getName() + ", priority: " + thread.getPriority());
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, the `Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup()` method is used to get the thread group of the current thread. The `ThreadGroup.enumerate()` method is then called on this thread group to get an array of all currently running threads.

Before calling `ThreadGroup.enumerate()`, the `ThreadGroup.checkAccess()` method is called to ensure that the current thread has permission to access its thread group. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` will be thrown.
