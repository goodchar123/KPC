Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in the code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```
public static boolean searchWord(String str, String word) {
    try {
        String[] words = str.split("\\s+");
        for (String w : words) {
            if (w.equals(word)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        System.out.println("The input string is null.");
    }
    return false;
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to handle the `NullPointerException` that could occur if the input string is null. If the input string is null, the catch block will print an error message to the console. Otherwise, the method will continue to search for the word in the string as before.
