Please pay attention to SQLException.
You're right, SQLException is an important exception that can occur when working with JDBC connections in Java. SQLException is a checked exception that is thrown when an error occurs while accessing a database or executing a SQL statement.

Here's an updated version of the previous example that includes proper handling of SQLException:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class RetrieveTableContents {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;
        ResultSet rs = null;

        try {
            // Establish JDBC connection
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");

            // Create SQL statement
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            String sql = "SELECT * FROM mytable";
            rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);

            // Process the result set
            while (rs.next()) {
                int id = rs.getInt("id");
                String name = rs.getString("name");
                int age = rs.getInt("age");
                System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Close JDBC resources
            try {
                if (rs != null) {
                    rs.close();
                }
                if (stmt != null) {
                    stmt.close();
                }
                if (conn != null) {
                    conn.close();
                }
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we've added a try-catch block to catch any SQLException that might occur while executing the SQL statement or processing the result set. If an SQLException is caught, we simply print the stack trace to the console. This helps us identify the cause of the error and fix it.

It's important to handle SQLException properly in your JDBC code to ensure that your application is robust and can handle errors gracefully.
