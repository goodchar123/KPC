Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, handling exceptions is important in Java programming. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class RetrieveTableContents {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;
        ResultSet rs = null;

        try {
            // Establish JDBC connection
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");

            // Create SQL statement
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            String sql = "SELECT * FROM mytable";
            rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);

            // Process the result set
            while (rs.next()) {
                int id = rs.getInt("id");
                String name = rs.getString("name");
                int age = rs.getInt("age");
                System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Close JDBC resources
            try {
                if (rs != null) {
                    rs.close();
                }
                if (stmt != null) {
                    stmt.close();
                }
                if (conn != null) {
                    conn.close();
                }
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to handle any SQLExceptions that might be thrown during the execution of the method. We've also added a finally block to ensure that the JDBC resources are closed properly, even if an exception is thrown.
