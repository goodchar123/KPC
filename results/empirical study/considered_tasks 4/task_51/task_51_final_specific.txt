Please pay attention to SecurityException.
You're right, we should handle the `SecurityException` that can be thrown if the application doesn't have permission to access the file system. Here's an updated version of the method that handles the `SecurityException`:

```java
public static boolean fileExists(String filePath) {
    try {
        File file = new File(filePath);
        return file.exists();
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        System.err.println("SecurityException: " + e.getMessage());
        return false;
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch the `SecurityException` that can be thrown by the `File` constructor or the `exists()` method. If a `SecurityException` is caught, the method prints an error message to the console and returns `false`.
