Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static boolean fileExists(String filePath) {
    try {
        File file = new File(filePath);
        return file.exists();
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        System.err.println("SecurityException: " + e.getMessage());
        return false;
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        System.err.println("NullPointerException: " + e.getMessage());
        return false;
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to handle two potential exceptions: `SecurityException` and `NullPointerException`. If either of these exceptions is thrown, the method will print an error message to the console and return `false`. This way, the calling code can handle the error appropriately.
