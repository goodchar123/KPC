Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with lists. Here's an updated version of the `replaceElement` method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static void replaceElement(List<String> list, int index, String newElement) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException {
    try {
        list.set(index, newElement);
    } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
        System.out.println("Index out of bounds. Please provide a valid index.");
        throw e;
    }
}
```

In this version, we add a `try-catch` block to catch the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` that may be thrown if the provided index is out of bounds for the list. If an exception is caught, we print an error message and re-throw the exception to be handled by the calling code.

You can call this updated method in the same way as before:

```java
List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();
myList.add("apple");
myList.add("banana");
myList.add("cherry");

try {
    replaceElement(myList, 3, "orange");
} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    // Handle the exception here
}

System.out.println(myList); // Output: [apple, banana, cherry]
```

In this example, we try to replace an element at index 3, which is out of bounds for the list. The `replaceElement` method catches the exception and prints an error message, and the original list remains unchanged.
