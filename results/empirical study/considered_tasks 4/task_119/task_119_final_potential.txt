Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when interrupting a thread. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```
public static void interruptThread(Thread thread) {
    if (thread != null && thread.isAlive()) {
        try {
            thread.interrupt();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // Handle security exception
            System.err.println("SecurityException occurred while interrupting thread: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block around the `interrupt()` method call to catch any `SecurityException` that may be thrown. This exception can occur if the current thread does not have permission to interrupt the target thread. In the catch block, we're simply printing an error message to the console, but you could handle the exception in a different way depending on your specific use case.
