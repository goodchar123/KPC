Please pay attention to SecurityException.
You're right, it's important to handle the `SecurityException` that may be thrown when interrupting a thread. Here's an updated version of the method that handles this exception:

```
public static void interruptThread(Thread thread) {
    if (thread != null && thread.isAlive()) {
        try {
            thread.interrupt();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // Handle SecurityException
            System.err.println("Caught SecurityException: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block around the `interrupt()` call to catch any `SecurityException` that may be thrown. If a `SecurityException` is caught, we print an error message to the console. This way, we can handle the exception gracefully and prevent the program from crashing.

Please pay attention to SecurityException.
You're right, a `SecurityException` can be thrown if the calling thread does not have permission to interrupt the target thread. To handle this exception, you can add a try-catch block around the `interrupt()` method call and handle the exception appropriately. Here's an updated example:

```
public static void interruptThread(Thread thread) {
    if (thread != null && thread.isAlive()) {
        try {
            thread.interrupt();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // Handle SecurityException here
            System.err.println("SecurityException: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated example, we've added a try-catch block around the `interrupt()` method call and caught the `SecurityException`. You can replace the `System.err.println()` statement with your own error handling code.
