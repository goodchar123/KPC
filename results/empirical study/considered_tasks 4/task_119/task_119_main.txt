Please write a java method that interrupt a running Thread in Java
Sure, here's an example Java method that interrupts a running thread:

```
public static void interruptThread(Thread thread) {
    if (thread != null && thread.isAlive()) {
        thread.interrupt();
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Thread` object as a parameter and checks if it is not null and is currently running. If it is, it calls the `interrupt()` method on the thread to interrupt it.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread cannot modify this thread for java.lang.Thread.interrupt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks if the current thread has permission to interrupt the specified thread:

```
public static void interruptThread(Thread thread) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkAccess(thread);
    }
    if (thread != null && thread.isAlive()) {
        thread.interrupt();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed. If it is, it calls the `checkAccess()` method on the `SecurityManager` to check if the current thread has permission to modify the specified thread. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the current thread has permission, the method then checks if the specified thread is not null and is currently running. If it is, it calls the `interrupt()` method on the thread to interrupt it.

    } else {

    }
}
