Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files and directories. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class DirectoryChecker {
    public static boolean isDirectoryEmpty(String directoryPath) {
        File directory = new File(directoryPath);
        if (directory.isDirectory()) {
            try {
                String[] files = directory.list();
                if (files != null && files.length > 0) {
                    return false;
                }
                return true;
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                System.err.println("Unable to access directory: " + e.getMessage());
                return false;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to handle the `SecurityException` that may be thrown if we don't have permission to access the directory. If this exception is caught, we print an error message to the console and return `false`.
