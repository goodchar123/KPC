Please pay attention to SecurityException.
You're right, it's important to handle the `SecurityException` that can be thrown when creating a file. Here's an updated version of the method that includes a catch block for `SecurityException`:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileCreator {
    public static void createFile(String directoryPath, String fileName) {
        File directory = new File(directoryPath);
        if (!directory.exists()) {
            directory.mkdirs();
        }
        File file = new File(directory, fileName);
        try {
            file.createNewFile();
            System.out.println("File created successfully at " + file.getAbsolutePath());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error creating file: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.out.println("Security exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Now, if a `SecurityException` is thrown, the method will catch it and print an error message.
