Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when creating a file. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileCreator {
    public static void createFile(String directoryPath, String fileName) {
        File directory = new File(directoryPath);
        if (!directory.exists()) {
            directory.mkdirs();
        }
        File file = new File(directory, fileName);
        try {
            if (file.createNewFile()) {
                System.out.println("File created successfully at " + file.getAbsolutePath());
            } else {
                System.out.println("File already exists at " + file.getAbsolutePath());
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error creating file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any IOException that might occur when creating the file. If an exception is caught, the method prints an error message to the console.
