Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with HashMaps. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```
public static void iterateHashMap(HashMap<String, Integer> map) {
    try {
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            String key = entry.getKey();
            Integer value = entry.getValue();
            System.out.println("Key: " + key + ", Value: " + value);
        }
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        System.err.println("HashMap is null.");
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to handle the `NullPointerException` that could occur if the HashMap is null. If the HashMap is null, the catch block will print an error message to the console. You can add additional catch blocks to handle other exceptions that may occur.
