Thank you for bringing this to my attention. You are correct that the `getKey()` and `getValue()` methods of the `Map.Entry` interface may throw an `IllegalStateException` if the entry has been removed from the backing map. Here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes the appropriate exception handling:

```
public static void iterateHashMap(HashMap<String, Integer> map) {
    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
        String key;
        Integer value;
        try {
            key = entry.getKey();
            value = entry.getValue();
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            // Entry has been removed from the backing map
            continue;
        }
        System.out.println("Key: " + key + ", Value: " + value);
    }
}
```

In this version of the method, we use a try-catch block to handle the `IllegalStateException` that may be thrown by the `getKey()` and `getValue()` methods. If an exception is caught, we simply continue to the next iteration of the loop.
