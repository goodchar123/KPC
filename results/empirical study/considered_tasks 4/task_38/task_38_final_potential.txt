Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in our code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static String formatSeconds(int seconds) {
    try {
        int hours = seconds / 3600;
        int minutes = (seconds % 3600) / 60;
        int secs = seconds % 60;
        return String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", hours, minutes, secs);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        return "00:00:00";
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that might be thrown if the input value is negative or if there's a division by zero. If an exception is caught, we print an error message to the console and return a default value of "00:00:00". This ensures that our method always returns a valid string, even if the input is invalid.
