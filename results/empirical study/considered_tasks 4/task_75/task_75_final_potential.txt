Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files and directories. Here's an updated version of the `listDirectories` method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class DirectoryLister {
    public static void listDirectories(String directoryPath) {
        try {
            File directory = new File(directoryPath);
            File[] files = directory.listFiles();
            if (files != null) {
                for (File file : files) {
                    if (file.isDirectory()) {
                        System.out.println(file.getName());
                        listDirectories(file.getAbsolutePath());
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: directory does not exist");
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: access denied");
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block to catch potential exceptions. If the directory does not exist, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown, and if access to the directory is denied, a `SecurityException` will be thrown. In both cases, we print an error message to the console.

Of course, you can modify the error handling to suit your needs.
