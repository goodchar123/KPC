Please pay attention to SecurityException, IllegalArgumentException.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions that may occur when setting the thread priority. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public void setThreadPriority(Thread thread, int priority) {
    try {
        thread.setPriority(priority);
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        System.err.println("SecurityException: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        System.err.println("IllegalArgumentException: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to catch potential `SecurityException` and `IllegalArgumentException` exceptions that may occur when setting the thread priority. If an exception is caught, we print an error message to the console with the exception message.

This way, if an exception occurs, the program won't crash and we can handle the error gracefully.

Please pay attention to IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException.
You're right, it's important to handle exceptions properly in any method. Here's an updated version of the `setThreadPriority()` method that includes exception handling:

```java
public void setThreadPriority(Thread thread, int priority) throws IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException {
    try {
        thread.setPriority(priority);
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException | SecurityException e) {
        // Handle the exception appropriately
        System.err.println("Error setting thread priority: " + e.getMessage());
        throw e;
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `throws` clause to the method signature to indicate that it can throw `IllegalArgumentException` or `SecurityException`. 

Inside the method, we've wrapped the call to `setPriority()` in a try-catch block that catches both of these exceptions. If an exception is caught, we print an error message to the console and re-throw the exception so that the calling code can handle it further if needed.

By handling exceptions in this way, we ensure that any errors that occur during the thread priority setting process are properly reported and handled.
