Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when setting the priority of a thread. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public void setThreadPriority(Thread thread, int priority) {
    try {
        thread.setPriority(priority);
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        System.err.println("Invalid priority value: " + priority);
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        System.err.println("Unable to set thread priority due to security restrictions");
    }
}
```

In this version, we use a try-catch block to catch two potential exceptions that may be thrown when setting the thread priority: `IllegalArgumentException` and `SecurityException`. 

If an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown, it means that the priority value is invalid (i.e. not between 1 and 10), so we print an error message to the console.

If a `SecurityException` is thrown, it means that the current thread does not have permission to set the priority of the target thread due to security restrictions. In this case, we also print an error message to the console.
