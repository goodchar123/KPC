The code snippet I provided does not use the `System.arraycopy` method, so there is no need to check for those exceptions. However, if you are using `System.arraycopy` in your code, here are the checks you should perform:

1. To check if copying would cause access of data outside array bounds, you should ensure that the source and destination arrays have enough space to accommodate the number of elements being copied. You can do this by checking the length of the arrays and the starting and ending indices of the copy operation. If the copy operation would cause access of data outside array bounds, you should throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. To check if an element in the source array could not be stored into the destination array because of a type mismatch, you should ensure that the source and destination arrays have the same element type. You can do this by checking the class of the arrays using the `getClass()` method. If the arrays have different element types, you should throw an `ArrayStoreException`.

3. To check if either the source or destination array is null, you should check if either of them is null before calling `System.arraycopy()`. If either array is null, you should throw a `NullPointerException`.

```java
public static int[] getUpperBound(int[][] arr) throws NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, ArrayStoreException {
    if (arr == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Input array is null");
    }
    if (arr.length == 0 || arr[0].length == 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input array is empty");
    }
    int[] upperBound = new int[2];
    upperBound[0] = arr.length - 1;
    upperBound[1] = arr[0].length - 1;
    return upperBound;
}
```
