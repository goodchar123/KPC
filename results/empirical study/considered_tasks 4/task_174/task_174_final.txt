You are correct. It is important to check if the index is out of range before calling the `get()` method on a `Vector`. Here's an updated version of the `get()` method that includes this check:

```java
public static int get(Vector<Integer> vector, int index) {
    if (index < 0 || index >= vector.size()) {
        throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Index out of range");
    }
    return vector.get(index);
}
```

This version of the method first checks if the index is out of range by comparing it to the size of the vector. If the index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the size of the vector, the method throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` with an appropriate error message.

If the index is within range, the method returns the element at that index using the `get()` method of the `Vector`.
