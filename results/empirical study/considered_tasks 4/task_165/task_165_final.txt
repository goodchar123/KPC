Sure, here's an updated version of the `splitString` method that checks for invalid regular expression syntax and throws a `PatternSyntaxException` if necessary:

```java
import java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException;

public static String[] splitString(String input, String regex) throws PatternSyntaxException {
    try {
        return input.split(regex);
    } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any `PatternSyntaxException` that might be thrown by the `split()` method. If such an exception is caught, it is re-thrown to the calling code.

Here's an example usage of this updated method:

```java
String input = "Hello, world! How are you today?";
String regex = "[,! ]+"; // split on commas, exclamation marks, and spaces
try {
    String[] output = splitString(input, regex);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(output)); // prints "[Hello, world, How, are, you, today?]"
} catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
    System.out.println("Invalid regular expression syntax: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

In this example, the `splitString` method is called with a valid regular expression, so the resulting array of strings is printed to the console. However, if an invalid regular expression were passed to the method, a `PatternSyntaxException` would be thrown and caught, and an error message would be printed to the console.
