Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with strings and regular expressions. Here's an updated version of the `splitString` method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static String[] splitString(String input, String regex) throws PatternSyntaxException {
    try {
        return input.split(regex);
    } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `throws` clause to the method signature to indicate that it may throw a `PatternSyntaxException`. We've also added a `try-catch` block to catch this exception if it occurs, and re-throw it to the calling method.

Here's an example usage of this updated method:

```java
String input = "Hello, world! How are you today?";
String regex = "[,! ]+"; // split on commas, exclamation marks, and spaces
try {
    String[] output = splitString(input, regex);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(output)); // prints "[Hello, world, How, are, you, today?]"
} catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
    System.out.println("Invalid regular expression: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

In this example, we've wrapped the call to `splitString` in a `try-catch` block to handle the potential `PatternSyntaxException`. If this exception occurs, we print an error message to the console.
