Please pay attention to PatternSyntaxException.
You're right, it's important to handle `PatternSyntaxException` when working with regular expressions in Java. This exception is thrown when the syntax of the regular expression is invalid.

Here's an updated version of the `splitString` method that handles `PatternSyntaxException`:

```java
public static String[] splitString(String input, String regex) {
    try {
        return input.split(regex);
    } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
        System.err.println("Invalid regular expression: " + regex);
        return new String[] { input };
    }
}
```

In this version, we wrap the call to `split()` in a try-catch block that catches `PatternSyntaxException`. If this exception is thrown, we print an error message to the console and return an array containing the original input string.

Here's an example usage of this updated method:

```java
String input = "Hello, world! How are you today?";
String regex = "[,! ]+"; // split on commas, exclamation marks, and spaces
String[] output = splitString(input, regex);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(output)); // prints "[Hello, world, How, are, you, today?]"
```

In this example, the regular expression is valid, so the method returns the expected output. However, if we were to pass an invalid regular expression, such as `[*+`, the method would catch the `PatternSyntaxException` and return an array containing the original input string.
