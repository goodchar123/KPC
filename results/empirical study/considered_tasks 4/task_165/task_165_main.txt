Please write a java method that split a regular expression in Java
Here's an example Java method that splits a string using a regular expression:

```java
public static String[] splitString(String input, String regex) {
    return input.split(regex);
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the input string to be split, and the regular expression to use as the delimiter. It then calls the `split()` method on the input string, passing in the regular expression as the delimiter. The resulting array of strings is returned.

Here's an example usage of this method:

```java
String input = "Hello, world! How are you today?";
String regex = "[,! ]+"; // split on commas, exclamation marks, and spaces
String[] output = splitString(input, regex);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(output)); // prints "[Hello, world, How, are, you, today?]"
```

In this example, the input string is split on commas, exclamation marks, and spaces using the regular expression `[,! ]+`. The resulting array of strings is printed to the console.

Please check if the regular expression's syntax is invalid for java.lang.String.split(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw PatternSyntaxException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `splitString` method that checks for invalid regular expression syntax and throws a `PatternSyntaxException` if necessary:

```java
import java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException;

public static String[] splitString(String input, String regex) throws PatternSyntaxException {
    try {
        return input.split(regex);
    } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any `PatternSyntaxException` that might be thrown by the `split()` method. If such an exception is caught, it is re-thrown to the calling code.

Here's an example usage of this updated method:

```java
String input = "Hello, world! How are you today?";
String regex = "[,! ]+"; // split on commas, exclamation marks, and spaces
try {
    String[] output = splitString(input, regex);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(output)); // prints "[Hello, world, How, are, you, today?]"
} catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
    System.out.println("Invalid regular expression syntax: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

In this example, the `splitString` method is called with a valid regular expression, so the resulting array of strings is printed to the console. However, if an invalid regular expression were passed to the method, a `PatternSyntaxException` would be thrown and caught, and an error message would be printed to the console.
