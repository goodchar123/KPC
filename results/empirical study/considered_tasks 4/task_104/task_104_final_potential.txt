Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You are right. Here is an updated version of the method that handles potential exceptions:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class PortChecker {
    public static boolean isPortInUse(int port) {
        try {
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket();
            serverSocket.setReuseAddress(true);
            serverSocket.bind(new InetSocketAddress("localhost", port));
            serverSocket.close();
            return false;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return true;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated version of the method sets the `reuseAddress` property of the `ServerSocket` object to `true` before binding it to the specified port. This ensures that the port is released immediately after the `ServerSocket` object is closed, even if there are still connections open on the port. This helps to avoid potential exceptions that could occur if the port is not released properly.

Additionally, the method catches any exceptions that may occur during the creation of the `ServerSocket` object and returns `true` to indicate that the port is being used.
