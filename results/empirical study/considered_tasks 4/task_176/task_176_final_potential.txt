Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in the code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static int findMax(Vector<Integer> vector) throws NoSuchElementException {
    if (vector.isEmpty()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("Vector is empty");
    }
    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++) {
        if (vector.get(i) > max) {
            max = vector.get(i);
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

In this version, we first check if the vector is empty and throw a `NoSuchElementException` if it is. This ensures that the method doesn't try to find the maximum element of an empty vector, which would result in an error. 

If the vector is not empty, the method proceeds to find the maximum element as before.
