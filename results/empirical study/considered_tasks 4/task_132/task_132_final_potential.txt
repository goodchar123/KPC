Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in Java code. Here's an updated version of the code that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.awt.Graphics;
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JPanel;

public class LineDrawing extends JPanel {
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        g.drawLine(10, 10, 100, 100);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            JFrame frame = new JFrame("Line Drawing");
            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
            frame.add(new LineDrawing());
            frame.setSize(200, 200);
            frame.setVisible(true);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block around the code that sets up the window and adds the `JPanel` to it. If an exception is thrown, the catch block will catch it and print an error message to the console. This helps to ensure that the program doesn't crash unexpectedly and that the user is informed of any errors that occur.
