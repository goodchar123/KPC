Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You are right. Here is an updated version of the Java method that handles potential exceptions:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.temporal.WeekFields;
import java.util.Locale;

public class WeekOfMonthFinder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
            int weekOfYear = date.get(WeekFields.of(Locale.getDefault()).weekOfYear());
            int weekOfMonth = (date.getDayOfMonth() - 1) / 7 + 1;
            int month = date.getMonthValue();
            System.out.println("Week of year: " + weekOfYear);
            System.out.println("Week of month: " + weekOfMonth);
            System.out.println("Month: " + month);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we have added a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions that may occur. If an exception occurs, we print an error message that includes the exception message.

It's always a good practice to handle exceptions in your code to prevent unexpected behavior and improve the reliability of your application.
