List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only fully qualified name with parameters, no other text. Parameters types must be fully qualified, exclude the parameter names. Display in a list. Each fully qualified name should be enclosed in a backticks (`)
1. `java.sql.Connection.setAutoCommit(boolean)`
2. `java.sql.Connection.setSavepoint(java.lang.String)`
3. `java.sql.Connection.rollback(java.sql.Savepoint)`
4. `java.sql.Connection.commit()`
5. `java.sql.Connection.close()`
6. `java.sql.SQLException.printStackTrace()`
7. `java.lang.StringBuilder.<init>()` (implicitly used in the `StringBuilder` append operations)

 + From response, we get: ['java.sql.Connection.setAutoCommit(boolean)', 'java.sql.Connection.setSavepoint(java.lang.String)', 'java.sql.Connection.rollback(java.sql.Savepoint)', 'java.sql.Connection.commit()', 'java.sql.Connection.close()', 'java.sql.SQLException.printStackTrace()', 'java.lang.StringBuilder.<init>()']

Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.setAutoCommit(boolean) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLException` is caught and handled in the `catch` block of the `try-catch` statement that surrounds the code that calls `setAutoCommit(false)`.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.setSavepoint(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SQLException` is not handled or caught for `setSavepoint(String)` in the code snippet. If an `SQLException` is thrown by this method, it will propagate up the call stack and be caught by the `catch` block that surrounds the entire `try-catch` statement.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLFeatureNotSupportedException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.setSavepoint(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is not handled or caught for `setSavepoint(String)` in the code snippet. If a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown by this method, it will propagate up the call stack and be caught by the `catch` block that surrounds the entire `try-catch` statement.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.rollback(java.sql.Savepoint) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLException` is caught and handled in the `catch` block of the `try-catch` statement that surrounds the code that calls `rollback(savepoint)`.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLFeatureNotSupportedException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.rollback(java.sql.Savepoint) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is not handled or caught for `rollback(Savepoint)` in the code snippet. If a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown by this method, it will propagate up the call stack and be caught by the `catch` block that surrounds the entire `try-catch` statement.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.commit() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLException` is caught and handled in the `catch` block of the `try-catch` statement that surrounds the code that calls `commit()`.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLException` is caught and handled in the `catch` block of the `finally` statement that surrounds the code that calls `close()`.
