Please write a java method that make a Savepoint & Rollback in Java
Sure, here's an example Java method that creates a savepoint and performs a rollback:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class SavepointExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Connection conn = null;
        Savepoint savepoint = null;
        try {
            // Connect to database
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");
            
            // Set auto-commit to false
            conn.setAutoCommit(false);
            
            // Create a savepoint
            savepoint = conn.setSavepoint("savepoint1");
            
            // Perform some database operations
            // ...
            
            // Rollback to the savepoint
            conn.rollback(savepoint);
            
            // Commit the transaction
            conn.commit();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Rollback to the savepoint if an exception occurs
            if (savepoint != null) {
                try {
                    conn.rollback(savepoint);
                } catch (SQLException ex) {
                    ex.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Close the connection
            if (conn != null) {
                try {
                    conn.close();
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we first connect to a MySQL database and set the auto-commit mode to false. We then create a savepoint using the `setSavepoint()` method and perform some database operations. If an exception occurs, we rollback to the savepoint using the `rollback()` method. Finally, we commit the transaction and close the connection.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs, this method is called while participating in a distributed transaction, if this method is called on a closed connection or this            Connection object is in auto commit mode for java.sql.Connection.commit() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws a `SQLException` if any of them occur:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class SavepointExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
        Connection conn = null;
        Savepoint savepoint = null;
        try {
            // Connect to database
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");
            
            // Check if connection is closed
            if (conn.isClosed()) {
                throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
            }
            
            // Check if connection is in auto-commit mode
            if (conn.getAutoCommit()) {
                throw new SQLException("Connection is in auto-commit mode");
            }
            
            // Create a savepoint
            savepoint = conn.setSavepoint("savepoint1");
            
            // Perform some database operations
            // ...
            
            // Rollback to the savepoint
            conn.rollback(savepoint);
            
            // Commit the transaction
            conn.commit();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Rollback to the savepoint if an exception occurs
            if (savepoint != null) {
                try {
                    conn.rollback(savepoint);
                } catch (SQLException ex) {
                    ex.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            throw e;
        } finally {
            // Close the connection
            if (conn != null) {
                try {
                    conn.close();
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if the connection is closed or in auto-commit mode before creating the savepoint. If either of these conditions are true, we throw a `SQLException`. If an exception occurs during the transaction, we rollback to the savepoint and re-throw the exception.

Please check if a database access error occurs, this method is called while participating in a distributed transaction, if this method is called on a closed connection or this            Connection object is in auto commit mode for java.sql.Connection.commit() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws a `SQLException` if any of them occur:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class SavepointExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
        Connection conn = null;
        Savepoint savepoint = null;
        try {
            // Connect to database
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");
            
            // Check if connection is closed
            if (conn.isClosed()) {
                throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
            }
            
            // Check if connection is in auto-commit mode
            if (conn.getAutoCommit()) {
                throw new SQLException("Connection is in auto-commit mode");
            }
            
            // Check if connection is participating in a distributed transaction
            if (conn.getTransactionIsolation() == Connection.TRANSACTION_NONE) {
                throw new SQLException("Connection is not participating in a distributed transaction");
            }
            
            // Create a savepoint
            savepoint = conn.setSavepoint("savepoint1");
            
            // Perform some database operations
            // ...
            
            // Rollback to the savepoint
            conn.rollback(savepoint);
            
            // Commit the transaction
            conn.commit();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Rollback to the savepoint if an exception occurs
            if (savepoint != null) {
                try {
                    conn.rollback(savepoint);
                } catch (SQLException ex) {
                    ex.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            throw e;
        } finally {
            // Close the connection
            if (conn != null) {
                try {
                    conn.close();
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if the connection is closed, in auto-commit mode, or not participating in a distributed transaction before creating the savepoint. If any of these conditions are true, we throw a `SQLException`. If an exception occurs during the transaction, we rollback to the savepoint and re-throw the exception.
