Please pay attention to IllegalMonitorStateException, IllegalThreadStateException, IllegalArgumentException.
Certainly, here's an explanation of each of these exceptions:

1. `IllegalMonitorStateException`: This exception is thrown when a thread tries to wait, notify, or notifyAll on an object without owning the object's monitor. In other words, the thread must have acquired the object's monitor using the `synchronized` keyword before calling these methods.

2. `IllegalThreadStateException`: This exception is thrown when a thread tries to perform an illegal operation on a thread. For example, if a thread tries to start itself using the `start()` method, this exception will be thrown.

3. `IllegalArgumentException`: This exception is thrown when a method is called with an illegal or inappropriate argument. For example, if a negative value is passed to the `sleep()` method, this exception will be thrown.

It's important to handle these exceptions properly in your code to ensure that your program runs smoothly and doesn't crash unexpectedly.

Please pay attention to IllegalArgumentException, IllegalMonitorStateException, IllegalThreadStateException.
Sure, here's an explanation of each of these exceptions:

1. IllegalArgumentException: This exception is thrown when a method is passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. For example, if a method expects a positive integer as an argument and is passed a negative integer, it may throw an IllegalArgumentException.

2. IllegalMonitorStateException: This exception is thrown when a thread tries to wait, notify, or notifyAll on an object's monitor that it does not own. In other words, the thread must have acquired the object's monitor using the synchronized keyword before it can call these methods.

3. IllegalThreadStateException: This exception is thrown when a thread is not in an appropriate state for the requested operation. For example, if a thread is already started and the start() method is called again, it may throw an IllegalThreadStateException.

It's important to handle these exceptions properly in your code to ensure that it runs smoothly and doesn't crash unexpectedly.
