Please write a java method that make a server to allow the connection to the socket 6123 in Java
Here is an example Java method that creates a server socket and listens for incoming connections on port 6123:

```java
public void startServer() {
    try {
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(6123);
        System.out.println("Server started on port 6123");

        while (true) {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            System.out.println("Client connected: " + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());

            // Handle client connection here

            clientSocket.close();
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.err.println("Error starting server: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method creates a `ServerSocket` object on port 6123 and enters a loop to accept incoming connections. When a client connects, it prints a message to the console and then closes the connection. You can add your own code to handle the client connection inside the loop.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a security manager exists and its             checkAccept method doesn't allow the operation. for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check if a timeout was previously set with setSoTimeout and             the timeout has been reached. for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SocketTimeoutException.
Please check if this socket has an associated channel, the channel is in             non blocking mode, and there is no connection ready to be             accepted for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalBlockingModeException.
Here is the updated Java method that includes the security manager check, timeout check, and blocking mode check:

```java
public void startServer() throws IOException {
    ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(6123);
    System.out.println("Server started on port 6123");

    while (true) {
        try {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            System.out.println("Client connected: " + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());

            // Handle client connection here

            clientSocket.close();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.err.println("Security manager check failed: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (SocketTimeoutException e) {
            System.err.println("Timeout reached: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IllegalBlockingModeException e) {
            System.err.println("Socket is in non-blocking mode: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This method now includes try-catch blocks to handle the `SecurityException`, `SocketTimeoutException`, and `IllegalBlockingModeException` that may be thrown by the `accept()` method. If any of these exceptions are caught, an error message is printed to the console. Note that the `IOException` is thrown by the `ServerSocket` constructor and does not need to be caught explicitly in this method.
