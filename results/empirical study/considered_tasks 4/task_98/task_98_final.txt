Here is the updated Java method that includes the security manager check, timeout check, and blocking mode check:

```java
public void startServer() throws IOException {
    ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(6123);
    System.out.println("Server started on port 6123");

    while (true) {
        try {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            System.out.println("Client connected: " + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());

            // Handle client connection here

            clientSocket.close();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.err.println("Security manager check failed: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (SocketTimeoutException e) {
            System.err.println("Timeout reached: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IllegalBlockingModeException e) {
            System.err.println("Socket is in non-blocking mode: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This method now includes try-catch blocks to handle the `SecurityException`, `SocketTimeoutException`, and `IllegalBlockingModeException` that may be thrown by the `accept()` method. If any of these exceptions are caught, an error message is printed to the console. Note that the `IOException` is thrown by the `ServerSocket` constructor and does not need to be caught explicitly in this method.
