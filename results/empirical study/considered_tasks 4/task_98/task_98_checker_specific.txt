List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only fully qualified name with parameters, no other text. Parameters types must be fully qualified, exclude the parameter names. Display in a list. Each fully qualified name should be enclosed in a backticks (`)
1. `java.net.ServerSocket.ServerSocket(int port)`
2. `java.net.ServerSocket.accept()`
3. `java.net.Socket.getInetAddress()`
4. `java.net.Socket.getHostAddress()`
5. `java.net.Socket.close()`
6. `java.io.IOException.getMessage()`

 + From response, we get: ['java.net.ServerSocket.ServerSocket(intport)', 'java.net.ServerSocket.accept()', 'java.net.Socket.getInetAddress()', 'java.net.Socket.getHostAddress()', 'java.net.Socket.close()', 'java.io.IOException.getMessage()']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `catch` block of the `try-catch` statement that surrounds the `ServerSocket` and `accept()` method calls.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SecurityException handled or caught for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SecurityException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If a `SecurityException` is thrown during the execution of the `try` block, it will propagate up the call stack and may cause the program to terminate.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SocketTimeoutException handled or caught for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SocketTimeoutException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If a `SocketTimeoutException` is thrown during the execution of the `try` block, it will propagate up the call stack and may cause the program to terminate.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IllegalBlockingModeException handled or caught for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IllegalBlockingModeException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If an `IllegalBlockingModeException` is thrown during the execution of the `try` block, it will propagate up the call stack and may cause the program to terminate.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.net.Socket.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `catch` block of the `try-catch` statement that surrounds the `close()` method call.
