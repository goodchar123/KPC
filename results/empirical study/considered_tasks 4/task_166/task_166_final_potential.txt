Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in the code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static String replaceFirst(String originalString, String searchString, String replacementString) {
    try {
        int index = originalString.indexOf(searchString);
        if (index == -1) {
            return originalString;
        }
        return originalString.substring(0, index) + replacementString + originalString.substring(index + searchString.length());
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("An error occurred while replacing the string: " + e.getMessage());
        return originalString;
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur while executing the code. If an exception is caught, we print an error message to the console and return the original string as is. This way, the method won't crash if an exception occurs, and we can handle the error gracefully.
