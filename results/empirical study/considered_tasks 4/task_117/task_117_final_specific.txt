Please pay attention to SecurityException.
You're right, thank you for bringing that up. The `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` method can throw a `SecurityException` if the current thread is not allowed to access some of the threads in the system. To handle this exception, you can modify the method like this:

```
public static void displayRunningThreads() {
    try {
        Set<Thread> threadSet = Thread.getAllStackTraces().keySet();
        for (Thread thread : threadSet) {
            System.out.println("Thread name: " + thread.getName() + ", Thread ID: " + thread.getId());
        }
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        System.err.println("Unable to access all threads: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This version of the method catches the `SecurityException` and prints an error message to the standard error stream.
