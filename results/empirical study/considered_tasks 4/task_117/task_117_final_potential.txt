Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```
public static void displayRunningThreads() {
    try {
        Set<Thread> threadSet = Thread.getAllStackTraces().keySet();
        for (Thread thread : threadSet) {
            System.out.println("Thread name: " + thread.getName() + ", Thread ID: " + thread.getId());
        }
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        System.err.println("Unable to access all threads: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to handle the `SecurityException` that may be thrown if the current thread doesn't have permission to access all threads. If this exception is caught, we print an error message to the console.
