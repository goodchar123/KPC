Sure, here's the updated code that checks for a security manager and calls its `checkWrite` method before creating the file:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CreateFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fileName = "example.txt";
        SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (securityManager != null) {
            securityManager.checkWrite(fileName);
        }
        try {
            File file = new File(fileName);
            if (file.createNewFile()) {
                System.out.println("File created: " + file.getName());
            } else {
                System.out.println("File already exists.");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.out.println("Access denied.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This code first checks if a security manager is present using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If one is present, it calls its `checkWrite` method with the file name as an argument to check if write access is allowed. If write access is denied, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If no security manager is present or write access is allowed, the file is created as before. If an error occurs during the file creation process, it prints an error message and the stack trace.
