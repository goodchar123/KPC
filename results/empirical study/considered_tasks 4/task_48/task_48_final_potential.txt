Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when creating a file. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CreateFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fileName = "example.txt";
        try {
            File file = new File(fileName);
            if (file.createNewFile()) {
                System.out.println("File created: " + file.getName());
            } else {
                System.out.println("File already exists.");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred while creating the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.out.println("A security exception occurred while creating the file.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we catch two potential exceptions: `IOException` and `SecurityException`. `IOException` is thrown if an I/O error occurs while creating the file, such as if the file already exists or if there is a problem with the file system. `SecurityException` is thrown if a security manager denies access to the file. In each catch block, we print an error message and the stack trace to help diagnose the problem.
