Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions. Here's an updated version of the code that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class RootDirectories {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File[] roots = File.listRoots();
            for (File root : roots) {
                System.out.println(root.getAbsolutePath());
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've enclosed the code that could potentially throw an exception in a `try` block. If an exception is thrown, the `catch` block will catch it and print out an error message. This way, the program won't crash if an exception occurs.
