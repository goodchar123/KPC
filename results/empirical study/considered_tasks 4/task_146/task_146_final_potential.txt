Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with JDBC connections. Here's an updated version of the `updateTable` method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class TableUpdater {
    
    // Update method to delete, insert or update contents of a table
    public void updateTable(String query) {
        // JDBC connection variables
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
        String username = "root";
        String password = "mypassword";
        
        // JDBC objects
        Connection connection = null;
        PreparedStatement statement = null;
        
        try {
            // Establish JDBC connection
            connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
            
            // Prepare SQL statement
            statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
            
            // Execute SQL statement
            statement.executeUpdate();
            
            System.out.println("Table updated successfully.");
            
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Error updating table: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            // Close JDBC objects
            try {
                if (statement != null) {
                    statement.close();
                }
                if (connection != null) {
                    connection.close();
                }
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                System.out.println("Error closing JDBC objects: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block to catch any `SQLException` that might occur when establishing the JDBC connection, preparing the SQL statement, or executing the statement. We've also added a `finally` block to ensure that the JDBC objects are closed properly, even if an exception is thrown.

It's important to handle exceptions properly when working with JDBC connections, as they can indicate issues with the database or network connectivity.

It's important to handle exceptions properly when working with JDBC connections, as they can indicate issues with the database or network connectivity. By catching and handling exceptions, we can provide more informative error messages to the user and ensure that the application doesn't crash unexpectedly.
