Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an `IOException` when closing the `FileWriter` and throws it if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileAppender {
    public static void appendToFile(String fileName, String content) throws IOException {
        FileWriter writer = null;
        try {
            writer = new FileWriter(fileName, true);
            writer.write(content);
        } finally {
            if (writer != null) {
                try {
                    writer.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new IOException("Error closing FileWriter: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method now throws an `IOException` if an error occurs while closing the `FileWriter`. It also uses a `finally` block to ensure that the `FileWriter` is always closed, even if an exception is thrown while writing to the file.

You can call this method like this:

```java
try {
    FileAppender.appendToFile("myfile.txt", "This is some new content to append.");
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

This will append the string "This is some new content to append." to the end of the file "myfile.txt", and if an `IOException` occurs, it will be caught and its stack trace will be printed to the console.
