Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with databases. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```
public void updateEmployeeSalary(int employeeId, double newSalary) {
    Connection conn = null;
    PreparedStatement stmt = null;
    try {
        // Create a connection to the database
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");

        // Create a prepared statement with placeholders for the employee ID and new salary
        stmt = conn.prepareStatement("UPDATE employees SET salary = ? WHERE id = ?");

        // Set the values for the placeholders
        stmt.setDouble(1, newSalary);
        stmt.setInt(2, employeeId);

        // Execute the update statement
        int rowsUpdated = stmt.executeUpdate();

        // Print the number of rows updated
        System.out.println(rowsUpdated + " rows updated.");

    } catch (SQLException e) {
        System.out.println("Error updating employee salary: " + e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        // Close the statement and connection
        try {
            if (stmt != null) {
                stmt.close();
            }
            if (conn != null) {
                conn.close();
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Error closing statement or connection: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we use a try-catch-finally block to handle potential SQLExceptions. We also close the statement and connection in the finally block to ensure that they are always closed, even if an exception is thrown.
