Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle exceptions properly. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class MultiSQLExecutor {
    
    private Connection connection;
    
    public MultiSQLExecutor(Connection connection) {
        this.connection = connection;
    }
    
    public void executeSQL(String[] sqlCommands) {
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[sqlCommands.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < sqlCommands.length; i++) {
            final String sqlCommand = sqlCommands[i];
            threads[i] = new Thread(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    try {
                        Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
                        statement.execute(sqlCommand);
                        statement.close();
                    } catch (SQLException e) {
                        System.err.println("Error executing SQL command: " + sqlCommand);
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            });
            threads[i].start();
        }
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            try {
                thread.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.err.println("Thread interrupted while executing SQL commands.");
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, the SQLException is caught and printed to the console along with the SQL command that caused the error. If an InterruptedException occurs while joining the threads, it is also caught and printed to the console.
