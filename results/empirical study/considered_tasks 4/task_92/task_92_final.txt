Sure, here's an updated version of the `getIPAddress` method that checks for the existence of a security manager and calls its `checkConnect` method before performing the `InetAddress.getByName` operation:

```java
import java.net.*;

public static String getIPAddress(String hostname) {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        try {
            sm.checkConnect(hostname, -1);
        } catch (SecurityException se) {
            throw se;
        }
    }
    try {
        InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName(hostname);
        return address.getHostAddress();
    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
        return null;
    }
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager is present using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If one is present, it calls its `checkConnect` method with the hostname and a port number of -1 (indicating that no specific port is being used). If the security manager disallows the operation, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If no security manager is present or if the `checkConnect` method allows the operation, the method proceeds to perform the `InetAddress.getByName` operation as before.

Note that this method assumes that the security manager's `checkConnect` method is being used to control network access. If a different security manager method is being used, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
