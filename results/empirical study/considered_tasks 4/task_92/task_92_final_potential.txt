Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle exceptions properly. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.net.*;

public static String getIPAddress(String hostname) {
    try {
        InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName(hostname);
        return address.getHostAddress();
    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
        System.err.println("Unable to resolve hostname: " + hostname);
        return null;
    }
}
```

In this version, we catch the `UnknownHostException` that may be thrown if the hostname cannot be resolved, and print an error message to the console. We also return `null` to indicate that the operation failed.
