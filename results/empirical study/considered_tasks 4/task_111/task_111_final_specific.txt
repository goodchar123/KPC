Please pay attention to IllegalArgumentException.
You are correct. It is important to handle the `IllegalArgumentException` that may be thrown if the `Thread` object passed to the method is `null`. Here is an updated version of the method that includes this exception handling:

```
public static void monitorThreadStatus(Thread thread) {
    if (thread == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Thread cannot be null");
    }
    while (thread.isAlive()) {
        System.out.println("Thread is still running...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // wait for 1 second
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    System.out.println("Thread has finished.");
}
```

This updated version first checks if the `Thread` object is `null` and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a descriptive message if it is. This ensures that the method is being used correctly and avoids any potential `NullPointerExceptions` later on.
