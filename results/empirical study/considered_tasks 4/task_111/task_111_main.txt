Please write a java method that monitor a thread's status in Java
Here is an example Java method that monitors a thread's status:

```
public static void monitorThreadStatus(Thread thread) {
    while (thread.isAlive()) {
        System.out.println("Thread is still running...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // wait for 1 second
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    System.out.println("Thread has finished.");
}
```

This method takes a `Thread` object as a parameter and continuously checks if the thread is still alive using the `isAlive()` method. If the thread is still running, it prints a message to the console and waits for 1 second using the `Thread.sleep()` method. If the thread has finished, it prints a message to the console indicating that the thread has finished.

Please check if the value of millis is negative for java.lang.Thread.sleep(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the value of `millis` is negative and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is:

```
public static void monitorThreadStatus(Thread thread) {
    while (thread.isAlive()) {
        System.out.println("Thread is still running...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // wait for 1 second
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    System.out.println("Thread has finished.");
}

public static void sleep(long millis) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    if (millis < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Sleep time cannot be negative.");
    }
    try {
        Thread.sleep(millis);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This updated version includes a new method called `sleep()` that takes a `long` value as a parameter and checks if it is negative. If it is, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the sleep time cannot be negative. If the value is non-negative, it calls the `Thread.sleep()` method with the given value.
