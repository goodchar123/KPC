Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in the code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```
public static void monitorThreadStatus(Thread thread) {
    while (thread.isAlive()) {
        System.out.println("Thread is still running...");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // wait for 1 second
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.err.println("Thread interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    System.out.println("Thread has finished.");
}
```

In this version, we catch the `InterruptedException` that can be thrown by the `Thread.sleep()` method and print an error message to the console. This ensures that the method doesn't crash if an exception is thrown.
