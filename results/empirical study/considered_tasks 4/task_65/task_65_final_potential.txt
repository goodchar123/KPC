Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files and directories. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class DirectoryHelper {
    public static boolean isHiddenDirectory(String directoryPath) {
        try {
            File directory = new File(directoryPath);
            return directory.isHidden();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur when creating the `File` object or calling the `isHidden()` method. If an exception is caught, it prints the stack trace and returns `false`.
