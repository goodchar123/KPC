Please pay attention to SecurityException.
You are correct. The `isHidden()` method of the `File` class can throw a `SecurityException` if the application does not have permission to read the directory. To handle this exception, you can modify the `isHiddenDirectory()` method as follows:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class DirectoryHelper {
    public static boolean isHiddenDirectory(String directoryPath) {
        File directory = new File(directoryPath);
        try {
            return directory.isHidden();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.err.println("Unable to determine if directory is hidden: " + e.getMessage());
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

In this modified method, we catch the `SecurityException` and print an error message to the console. We also return `false` to indicate that we were unable to determine if the directory is hidden.
