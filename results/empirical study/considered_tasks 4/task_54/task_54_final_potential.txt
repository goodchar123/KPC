Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileSize {
    public static long getFileSize(File file) {
        if (!file.exists() || !file.isFile()) {
            return -1;
        }
        try {
            return file.length();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.err.println("SecurityException: " + e.getMessage());
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block around the call to `file.length()`. This is because the method can throw a `SecurityException` if the security manager denies access to the file. If this happens, we print an error message to the console and return -1 to indicate that the file size could not be determined.
