Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in Java code. Here's an updated version of the code that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.*;

public class Banner extends Applet implements Runnable {
    String message = "Welcome to my website!";
    Thread t = null;
    int state;
    boolean stopFlag;

    public void init() {
        setBackground(Color.cyan);
        setForeground(Color.red);
    }

    public void start() {
        if (t == null) {
            t = new Thread(this);
            stopFlag = false;
            t.start();
        }
    }

    public void run() {
        char ch;

        while (true) {
            try {
                repaint();
                Thread.sleep(250);
                ch = message.charAt(0);
                message = message.substring(1, message.length());
                message += ch;
                if (stopFlag)
                    break;
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread interrupted.");
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }

    public void stop() {
        stopFlag = true;
        t = null;
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.drawString(message, 50, 30);
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to the `run()` method to catch any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the code. We've also added a check in the `start()` method to make sure that the thread is not already running before starting it again. Finally, we've added a catch block to the `Exception` class to catch any other exceptions that might occur. This will help us identify and handle any unexpected errors that might occur during the execution of the code.

We've also added a check in the `start()` method to make sure that the thread is not already running before starting it again. This helps to prevent any potential issues that might arise from starting multiple threads at the same time.
