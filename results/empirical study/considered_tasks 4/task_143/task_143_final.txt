Sure, here's an updated version of the `getConnection()` method that includes the error checking and exception throwing you requested:

```java
public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
    String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
    String username = "root";
    String password = "mypassword";
    Connection conn = null;
    try {
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error connecting to database", e);
    }
    return conn;
}
```

In this updated version, we first set the `conn` variable to `null`, then attempt to establish a connection using `DriverManager.getConnection()`. 

After establishing the connection, we check if the `Connection` object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the `Connection` is closed, we throw a new `SQLException` with a descriptive error message.

If an exception is thrown during the connection process, we catch it and re-throw it with a more descriptive error message. 

Finally, we return the `Connection` object if everything is successful.
