Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with databases. Here's an updated version of the `getConnection()` method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class DatabaseConnection {
    public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
        String username = "root";
        String password = "mypassword";
        Connection conn = null;
        try {
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Error connecting to database: " + e.getMessage());
            throw e;
        }
        return conn;
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block to catch any `SQLException` that might be thrown when attempting to connect to the database. If an exception is caught, we print an error message to the console and re-throw the exception so that the calling code can handle it appropriately.
