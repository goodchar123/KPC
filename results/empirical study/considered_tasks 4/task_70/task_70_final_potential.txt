Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files and directories. Here's an updated version of the `traverseDirectory()` method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class DirectoryTraversal {
    public static void traverseDirectory(File directory) {
        try {
            // Get all files and directories in the given directory
            File[] files = directory.listFiles();

            // Loop through each file/directory
            for (File file : files) {
                // If it's a directory, recursively call this method
                if (file.isDirectory()) {
                    traverseDirectory(file);
                } else {
                    // If it's a file, do something with it (e.g. print its name)
                    System.out.println(file.getName());
                }
            }
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            // Handle the case where the directory is null
            System.err.println("Error: directory is null");
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // Handle the case where we don't have permission to access the directory
            System.err.println("Error: permission denied to access directory");
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block to handle two potential exceptions: `NullPointerException` and `SecurityException`. The `NullPointerException` can occur if the directory is null, and the `SecurityException` can occur if we don't have permission to access the directory. In both cases, we print an error message to the console.
