Please pay attention to SecurityException.
You're right, it's important to handle `SecurityException` when traversing directories in Java. This exception can be thrown if the application doesn't have permission to access a file or directory.

Here's an updated version of the `traverseDirectory()` method that handles `SecurityException`:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.security.AccessControlException;

public class DirectoryTraversal {
    public static void traverseDirectory(File directory) {
        try {
            // Get all files and directories in the given directory
            File[] files = directory.listFiles();

            // Loop through each file/directory
            for (File file : files) {
                // If it's a directory, recursively call this method
                if (file.isDirectory()) {
                    traverseDirectory(file);
                } else {
                    // If it's a file, do something with it (e.g. print its name)
                    System.out.println(file.getName());
                }
            }
        } catch (AccessControlException e) {
            // Handle SecurityException
            System.err.println("Access denied: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block around the code that accesses the files and directories. If a `SecurityException` is thrown, we catch it and print an error message. This way, the application won't crash if it doesn't have permission to access a file or directory.
