Please pay attention to NullPointerException, SecurityException, IllegalArgumentException.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions that may occur when retrieving the current working directory. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static String getCurrentWorkingDirectory() {
    String currentWorkingDirectory = null;
    try {
        currentWorkingDirectory = System.getProperty("user.dir");
    } catch (NullPointerException | SecurityException | IllegalArgumentException e) {
        System.err.println("Error retrieving current working directory: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    return currentWorkingDirectory;
}
```

In this version, we use a try-catch block to catch any potential exceptions that may occur when retrieving the current working directory. We catch `NullPointerException`, `SecurityException`, and `IllegalArgumentException`, which are the most common exceptions that may occur in this case.

If an exception is caught, we print an error message to the console and return `null`. Otherwise, we return the current working directory as a string.

Please pay attention to IllegalArgumentException, NullPointerException, SecurityException.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions in our code. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static String getCurrentWorkingDirectory() throws IllegalArgumentException, NullPointerException, SecurityException {
    try {
        String currentWorkingDirectory = System.getProperty("user.dir");
        return currentWorkingDirectory;
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException | NullPointerException | SecurityException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

In this version, we use a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that might be thrown by the `System.getProperty()` method. We then re-throw the exception so that it can be handled by the calling code.

We also update the method signature to include the exceptions that might be thrown. In this case, we include `IllegalArgumentException`, `NullPointerException`, and `SecurityException`, which are the exceptions that the `System.getProperty()` method might throw.
