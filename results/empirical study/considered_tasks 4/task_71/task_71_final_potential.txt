Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
public static String getCurrentWorkingDirectory() {
    String currentWorkingDirectory = null;
    try {
        currentWorkingDirectory = System.getProperty("user.dir");
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        System.err.println("Unable to access the current working directory: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    return currentWorkingDirectory;
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block to handle the `SecurityException` that may be thrown if the security manager denies access to the system property. If an exception is caught, we print an error message to the console and return `null`. Otherwise, we return the current working directory as a string.
