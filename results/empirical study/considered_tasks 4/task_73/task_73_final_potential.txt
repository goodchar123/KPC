Please pay attention to potential exceptions.
You're right, it's important to handle potential exceptions when working with files. Here's an updated version of the method that includes exception handling:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileSearcher {
    public static void searchFile(String directoryPath, String fileName) {
        try {
            File directory = new File(directoryPath);
            File[] files = directory.listFiles();
            if (files != null) {
                for (File file : files) {
                    if (file.isDirectory()) {
                        searchFile(file.getAbsolutePath(), fileName);
                    } else {
                        if (file.getName().equals(fileName)) {
                            System.out.println("File found: " + file.getAbsolutePath());
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.err.println("Invalid directory path: " + directoryPath);
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.err.println("Access denied to directory: " + directoryPath);
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions. Specifically, we're catching `NullPointerException` and `SecurityException`. 

`NullPointerException` can occur if the `listFiles()` method returns `null`, which can happen if the directory path is invalid or if the directory doesn't exist. In this case, we print an error message to the console.

`SecurityException` can occur if we don't have permission to access the directory. In this case, we also print an error message to the console.

By handling these exceptions, we can make our method more robust and prevent it from crashing if something unexpected happens.
