Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed connections/result sets:

```java
public void setTableName(Connection conn, String columnName, String tableName) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    if (metaData == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve database metadata");
    }
    ResultSet rs = metaData.getColumns(null, null, columnName, null);
    if (rs == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve column information");
    }
    try {
        if (rs.next()) {
            String currentTableName = rs.getString("TABLE_NAME");
            if (!currentTableName.equals(tableName)) {
                String catalog = rs.getString("TABLE_CAT");
                String schema = rs.getString("TABLE_SCHEM");
                String column = rs.getString("COLUMN_NAME");
                metaData.renameColumn(catalog, schema, currentTableName, column, tableName);
            }
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to set table name for column: " + columnName, e);
    } finally {
        rs.close();
    }
}
```

This updated method now checks for a closed connection before retrieving the database metadata, and throws a `SQLException` if the connection is closed. It also checks for a null result set after calling `getColumns`, and throws a `SQLException` if the result set is null.

Additionally, the `ResultSet.next()` method is now called inside a try-catch block, and any `SQLException` that occurs during the call is caught and re-thrown with a more informative error message. Finally, the result set is closed in a `finally` block to ensure that it is always closed, even if an exception is thrown.
