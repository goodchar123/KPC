Please write a java method that Gets the value of the specified field from this day-of-week as an int.
Here's a Java method that gets the value of the specified field from a day-of-week as an int:

```java
public static int getFieldValue(DayOfWeek dayOfWeek, TemporalField field) {
    return dayOfWeek.get(field);
}
```

This method takes two parameters: `dayOfWeek`, which is the day-of-week you want to get the field value from, and `field`, which is the field you want to get the value of (e.g. `ChronoField.DAY_OF_WEEK`).

You can call this method like this:

```java
DayOfWeek monday = DayOfWeek.MONDAY;
int dayOfWeekValue = getFieldValue(monday, ChronoField.DAY_OF_WEEK);
System.out.println(dayOfWeekValue); // Output: 1
```

This will get the value of the `DAY_OF_WEEK` field from the `monday` object, which is `1` (since `1` represents Monday in the ISO-8601 standard).

Please check if a value for the field cannot be obtained or         the value is outside the range of valid values for the field for java.time.DayOfWeek.get(java.time.temporal.TemporalField) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Please check if the field is not supported or         the range of values exceeds an int for java.time.DayOfWeek.get(java.time.temporal.TemporalField) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException.
Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.DayOfWeek.get(java.time.temporal.TemporalField) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for exceptions:

```java
public static int getFieldValue(DayOfWeek dayOfWeek, TemporalField field) {
    try {
        return dayOfWeek.get(field);
    } catch (DateTimeException | UnsupportedTemporalTypeException | ArithmeticException e) {
        System.err.println("Exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        return -1; // or throw the exception further up the call stack
    }
}
```

This method now catches three possible exceptions that can occur when calling `dayOfWeek.get(field)`:

- `DateTimeException`: thrown if the value for the field cannot be obtained or is outside the range of valid values for the field.
- `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`: thrown if the field is not supported or the range of values exceeds an int.
- `ArithmeticException`: thrown if numeric overflow occurs.

If any of these exceptions occur, the method prints an error message and returns `-1` (or you can choose to throw the exception further up the call stack).

You can call this method like before:

```java
DayOfWeek monday = DayOfWeek.MONDAY;
int dayOfWeekValue = getFieldValue(monday, ChronoField.DAY_OF_WEEK);
System.out.println(dayOfWeekValue); // Output: 1
```

If an exception occurs, the error message will be printed to the console.
