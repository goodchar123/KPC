Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this ZonedDateTime with the month-of-year altered.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given `ZonedDateTime` object with the month-of-year altered:

```java
public static ZonedDateTime withMonth(ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime, int month) {
    return zonedDateTime.withMonth(month);
}
```

This method takes in a `ZonedDateTime` object and an integer value representing the desired month-of-year. It then returns a copy of the input `ZonedDateTime` object with the month-of-year altered to the specified value.

For example, if you have a `ZonedDateTime` object representing January 1st, 2022 at 12:00 PM in the UTC time zone:

```java
ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime = ZonedDateTime.of(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0, 0, ZoneOffset.UTC);
```

You can use the `withMonth` method to create a new `ZonedDateTime` object with the month-of-year set to February:

```java
ZonedDateTime newZonedDateTime = withMonth(zonedDateTime, 2);
```

The `newZonedDateTime` object will now represent February 1st, 2022 at 12:00 PM in the UTC time zone.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the month of year value is invalid for java.time.ZonedDateTime.withMonth(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `withMonth` method that checks if the month-of-year value is valid and throws a `DateTimeException` if it's not:

```java
public static ZonedDateTime withMonth(ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime, int month) {
    try {
        return zonedDateTime.withMonth(month);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid month-of-year value: " + month, e);
    }
}
```

This method uses a `try-catch` block to call the `withMonth` method on the input `ZonedDateTime` object and catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown if the month-of-year value is invalid.

If a `DateTimeException` is caught, the method throws a new `DateTimeException` with a custom error message that includes the invalid month-of-year value and the original exception as the cause.

You can use this updated `withMonth` method in the same way as before, but now it will throw an exception if an invalid month-of-year value is provided:

```java
ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime = ZonedDateTime.of(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0, 0, ZoneOffset.UTC);
ZonedDateTime newZonedDateTime = withMonth(zonedDateTime, 13); // throws DateTimeException
``` 

In this example, the `withMonth` method will throw a `DateTimeException` with the message "Invalid month-of-year value: 13".
