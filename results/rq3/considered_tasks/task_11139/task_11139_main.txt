Please write a java method that Creates a socket and connects it to the specified port number at the specified address.
Sure, here's an example Java method that creates a socket and connects it to a specified port number at a specified address:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class SocketExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String ipAddress = "127.0.0.1"; // IP address of the server
        int portNumber = 8080; // port number to connect to
        
        try {
            // create a socket and connect to the server
            Socket socket = new Socket(ipAddress, portNumber);
            
            // do something with the socket...
            
            // close the socket when done
            socket.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `Socket` object and connect it to the server at IP address `127.0.0.1` and port number `8080`. We then perform some operation on the socket (which you would replace with your own code), and finally close the socket when we're done. Note that we catch any exceptions that may occur during the socket creation and connection process.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when closing this socket. for java.net.Socket.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks for an I/O error when closing the socket:

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class SocketExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String ipAddress = "127.0.0.1"; // IP address of the server
        int portNumber = 8080; // port number to connect to
        
        try {
            // create a socket and connect to the server
            Socket socket = new Socket(ipAddress, portNumber);
            
            // do something with the socket...
            
            // close the socket and check for I/O errors
            try {
                socket.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we wrap the `socket.close()` call in a try-catch block that catches any `IOException` that may occur. If an I/O error occurs when closing the socket, we print the stack trace to the console. If you prefer, you could also throw the `IOException` instead of catching it and printing the stack trace.
