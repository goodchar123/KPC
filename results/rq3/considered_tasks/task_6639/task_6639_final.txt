Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the month-of-year value is valid and throws a `DateTimeException` if it is not:

```java
public static MonthDay withMonth(MonthDay monthDay, int month) {
    try {
        return monthDay.withMonth(month);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid month value: " + month, e);
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to call the `withMonth()` method on the `MonthDay` object and catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown if the month-of-year value is invalid. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `DateTimeException` with a custom error message that includes the invalid month value and the original exception as the cause.

This updated method ensures that any invalid month-of-year values are properly handled and reported to the caller.
