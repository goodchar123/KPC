Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this MonthDay with the month-of-year altered.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given MonthDay object with the month-of-year altered:

```java
public static MonthDay withMonth(MonthDay monthDay, int month) {
    return monthDay.withMonth(month);
}
```

This method takes a `MonthDay` object and an integer value representing the desired month-of-year. It then calls the `withMonth()` method on the `MonthDay` object, passing in the desired month value, and returns the resulting `MonthDay` object.

Note that the `withMonth()` method returns a new `MonthDay` object with the month-of-year altered, so the original `MonthDay` object is not modified.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the month of year value is invalid for java.time.MonthDay.withMonth(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the month-of-year value is valid and throws a `DateTimeException` if it is not:

```java
public static MonthDay withMonth(MonthDay monthDay, int month) {
    try {
        return monthDay.withMonth(month);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid month value: " + month, e);
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to call the `withMonth()` method on the `MonthDay` object and catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown if the month-of-year value is invalid. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `DateTimeException` with a custom error message that includes the invalid month value and the original exception as the cause.

This updated method ensures that any invalid month-of-year values are properly handled and reported to the caller.
