Please write a java method that Submits a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay, and subsequently with the given delay between the termination of one execution and the commencement of the next.
Here's an example Java method that submits a periodic action with an initial delay and a subsequent delay between executions:

```
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class PeriodicAction {
    public static void submitPeriodicAction(Runnable action, long initialDelay, long delay) {
        ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
        executor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(action, initialDelay, delay, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    }
}
```

This method takes in a `Runnable` object representing the action to be executed periodically, an `initialDelay` in milliseconds before the first execution, and a `delay` in milliseconds between the termination of one execution and the commencement of the next.

The method creates a `ScheduledExecutorService` with a single thread, and schedules the given action to be executed periodically with the specified initial delay and delay between executions using the `scheduleWithFixedDelay` method.

You can call this method with your own `Runnable` object and desired initial delay and delay between executions to submit a periodic action.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if corePoolSize < 0 for java.util.concurrent.Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if the task cannot be         scheduled for execution for java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(java.lang.Runnable,long,long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw RejectedExecutionException.
Please check if command or unit is null for java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(java.lang.Runnable,long,long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if delay less than or equal to zero for java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(java.lang.Runnable,long,long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested error checking:

```
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class PeriodicAction {
    public static void submitPeriodicAction(Runnable action, long initialDelay, long delay) {
        if (delay <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Delay must be greater than zero");
        }
        
        ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
        
        if (executor == null) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Executor service is null");
        }
        
        if (initialDelay < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Initial delay must be non-negative");
        }
        
        executor.scheduleWithFixedDelay(action, initialDelay, delay, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    }
}
```

This updated method checks for the following errors:

- If `delay` is less than or equal to zero, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that the delay must be greater than zero.
- If the `ScheduledExecutorService` returned by `Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1)` is null, a `RejectedExecutionException` is thrown with a message indicating that the executor service is null.
- If `initialDelay` is less than zero, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that the initial delay must be non-negative.
- If `command` or `unit` is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown by the `scheduleWithFixedDelay` method.

By including these error checks, the method ensures that the inputs are valid before scheduling the periodic action.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if corePoolSize < 0 for java.util.concurrent.Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if the task cannot be         scheduled for execution for java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(java.lang.Runnable,long,long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw RejectedExecutionException.
Please check if command or unit is null for java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(java.lang.Runnable,long,long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.

        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Core pool size must be non-negative");
        }
        
        if (executor == null) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Executor service is null");
        }

This updated method checks for the following errors:

- If `delay` is less than or equal to zero, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that the delay must be greater than zero.
- If `initialDelay` is less than zero, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that the initial delay must be non-negative.
- If `corePoolSize` is less than zero, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that the core pool size must be non-negative.
- If the `ScheduledExecutorService` returned by `Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1)` is null, a `RejectedExecutionException` is thrown with a message indicating that the executor service is null.
- If `command` or `unit` is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown by the `scheduleWithFixedDelay` method.
- If the task cannot be scheduled for execution, a `RejectedExecutionException` is thrown with a message indicating that the task cannot be scheduled.
