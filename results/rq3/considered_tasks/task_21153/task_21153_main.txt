Please write a java method that Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a long in the Java programming language.
Here's a Java method that reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a long:

```java
public long readNextAttributeAsLong(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
    return dataInputStream.readLong();
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as input and returns a `long`. It uses a `DataInputStream` to read the next attribute in the stream as a `long`. If an `IOException` occurs while reading the stream, it is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this input stream reaches the end before               reading eight bytes. for java.io.DataInputStream.readLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw EOFException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the input stream reaches the end before reading eight bytes:

```java
public long readNextAttributeAsLong(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
    if (dataInputStream.available() < 8) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return dataInputStream.readLong();
}
```

This method first checks if the number of bytes available in the input stream is less than 8 (the size of a `long`). If it is, an `EOFException` is thrown. Otherwise, it reads the next 8 bytes from the stream as a `long` using a `DataInputStream`. If an `IOException` occurs while reading the stream, it is thrown.
