
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the input stream reaches the end before reading eight bytes:

```java
public long readNextAttributeAsLong(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
    if (dataInputStream.available() < 8) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return dataInputStream.readLong();
}
```

This method first checks if the number of bytes available in the input stream is less than 8 (the size of a `long`). If it is, an `EOFException` is thrown. Otherwise, it reads the next 8 bytes from the stream as a `long` using a `DataInputStream`. If an `IOException` occurs while reading the stream, it is thrown.
