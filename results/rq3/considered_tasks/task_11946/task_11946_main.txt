Please write a java method that Closes the current ZIP entry and positions the stream for writing the next entry.
Here's a Java method that closes the current ZIP entry and positions the stream for writing the next entry:

```java
public void closeEntry(ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream) throws IOException {
    zipOutputStream.closeEntry();
}
```

This method takes a `ZipOutputStream` object as a parameter and calls its `closeEntry()` method to close the current ZIP entry and position the stream for writing the next entry. If an I/O error occurs, it throws an `IOException`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a ZIP format error has occurred for java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.closeEntry() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ZipException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a ZIP format error and throws a `ZipException` if one occurs:

```java
public void closeEntry(ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream) throws IOException, ZipException {
    try {
        zipOutputStream.closeEntry();
    } catch (ZipException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new ZipException("ZIP format error: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method still takes a `ZipOutputStream` object as a parameter and calls its `closeEntry()` method to close the current ZIP entry and position the stream for writing the next entry. However, it now catches any `ZipException` or `IOException` that may be thrown by the `closeEntry()` method and re-throws them. If any other type of exception is caught, it throws a new `ZipException` with a message indicating a ZIP format error has occurred.
