Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for I/O errors when creating the input stream:

```java
public void placeInputStreamAtEndOfStream(Socket socket) throws IOException {
    InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();
    if (inputStream == null) {
        throw new IOException("Input stream is null");
    }
    if (socket.isClosed()) {
        throw new IOException("Socket is closed");
    }
    if (!socket.isConnected()) {
        throw new IOException("Socket is not connected");
    }
    if (socket.isInputShutdown()) {
        throw new IOException("Socket input has been shutdown");
    }
    // Place the input stream at the end of the stream
    // ...
}
```

This updated method first checks for I/O errors when creating the input stream by checking if the input stream is null, the socket is closed, the socket is not connected, or the socket input has been shutdown using `isClosed()`, `isConnected()`, and `isInputShutdown()` methods. If any of these conditions are true, an `IOException` is thrown.

Note that the method does not yet place the input stream at the end of the stream. You can use the code snippet I provided earlier for that purpose.
