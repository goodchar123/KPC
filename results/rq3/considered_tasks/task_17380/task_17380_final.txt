You're right, it's important to handle potential I/O errors when writing to an `OutputStream`. Here's an updated version of the method that checks for I/O errors and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.sql.NClob;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class NClobWriter {
    public static void writeNClobToStream(NClob nclob, OutputStream outputStream) throws SQLException, IOException {
        long length = nclob.length();
        char[] buffer = new char[(int) length];
        nclob.getCharacterStream().read(buffer);
        try {
            outputStream.write(new String(buffer).getBytes());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing NCLOB to stream", e);
        }
    }
}
```

In this version of the method, we've wrapped the call to `outputStream.write()` in a try-catch block. If an `IOException` is thrown, we catch it and re-throw it as a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. This way, the caller of the method can handle the error appropriately.
