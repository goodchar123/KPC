Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that handles the `MBeanServerConnection.isInstanceOf(ObjectName, String)` method and checks for `InstanceNotFoundException` and `IOException`:

```java
import javax.management.MBeanServerConnection;
import javax.management.ObjectName;
import javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MBeanServerConnectionHandler {
    
    public boolean isInstanceOf(MBeanServerConnection connection, ObjectName objectName, String className) throws InstanceNotFoundException, IOException {
        try {
            return connection.isInstanceOf(objectName, className);
        } catch (InstanceNotFoundException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new IOException("A communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server.", e);
        }
    }
    
}
```

This updated method catches the `InstanceNotFoundException` and `IOException` exceptions thrown by the `isInstanceOf` method and re-throws them. If any other exception is thrown, it is caught and wrapped in an `IOException` with a message indicating a communication problem occurred.

Note that this method now declares that it throws `InstanceNotFoundException` and `IOException`, so any code calling this method will need to handle these exceptions appropriately.
