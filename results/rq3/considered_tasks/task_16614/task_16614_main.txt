Please write a java method that Creates a server mode Socket layered over an existing connected socket, and is able to read data which has already been consumed/removed from the Socket's underlying InputStream.
Here's an example Java method that creates a server mode Socket layered over an existing connected socket and reads data that has already been consumed/removed from the Socket's underlying InputStream:

```java
public static Socket createServerModeSocket(Socket socket) throws IOException {
    // Get the underlying input stream of the socket
    InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();

    // Read any data that has already been consumed/removed from the input stream
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);

    // Create a new server mode socket layered over the existing connected socket
    ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket();
    serverSocket.setReuseAddress(true);
    serverSocket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(socket.getLocalAddress(), 0));
    Socket serverModeSocket = serverSocket.accept();

    // Write the previously read data to the new socket's output stream
    OutputStream outputStream = serverModeSocket.getOutputStream();
    outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
    outputStream.flush();

    return serverModeSocket;
}
```

This method first gets the underlying input stream of the existing connected socket and reads any data that has already been consumed/removed from it. It then creates a new server mode socket using a `ServerSocket` object, sets the `reuseAddress` property to `true`, and binds it to a local address and a random port number. The method then accepts a connection on the server mode socket, which blocks until a client connects to it.

Finally, the method writes the previously read data to the output stream of the new socket and returns it. Note that this method assumes that the existing connected socket is still open and connected, and that the data that has already been consumed/removed from its input stream is still available in the underlying network buffers.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when creating the             input stream, the socket is closed, the socket is             not connected, or the socket input has been shutdown             using shutdownInput() for java.net.Socket.getInputStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if b is null. for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if an error occurs enabling or            disabling the SO_REUSEADDR            socket option, or the socket is closed. for java.net.ServerSocket.setReuseAddress(boolean) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SocketException.
Please check if a SecurityManager is present and its checkListen method doesn't allow the operation. for java.net.ServerSocket.bind(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check if endpoint is a          SocketAddress subclass not supported by this socket for java.net.ServerSocket.bind(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if a security manager exists and its             checkAccept method doesn't allow the operation. for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check if a timeout was previously set with setSoTimeout and             the timeout has been reached. for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SocketTimeoutException.
Please check if this socket has an associated channel, the channel is in             non blocking mode, and there is no connection ready to be             accepted for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalBlockingModeException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the error checking and exception handling you requested:

```java
public static Socket createServerModeSocket(Socket socket) throws IOException {
    // Get the underlying input stream of the socket
    InputStream inputStream = null;
    try {
        inputStream = socket.getInputStream();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error creating input stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    // Check if the socket is closed or not connected
    if (socket.isClosed() || !socket.isConnected()) {
        throw new IOException("Socket is closed or not connected");
    }

    // Check if the socket input has been shutdown
    if (socket.isInputShutdown()) {
        throw new IOException("Socket input has been shutdown");
    }

    // Read any data that has already been consumed/removed from the input stream
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int bytesRead = 0;
    try {
        if (inputStream != null) {
            bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer);
        } else {
            throw new IOException("Input stream is null");
        }
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Byte array is null");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error reading from input stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    // Create a new server mode socket layered over the existing connected socket
    ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket();
    try {
        serverSocket.setReuseAddress(true);
    } catch (SocketException e) {
        throw new SocketException("Error setting SO_REUSEADDR option: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    try {
        serverSocket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(socket.getLocalAddress(), 0));
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Security manager doesn't allow the operation: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Endpoint is not supported by this socket: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error binding server socket: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    Socket serverModeSocket = null;
    try {
        serverModeSocket = serverSocket.accept();
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Security manager doesn't allow the operation: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (SocketTimeoutException e) {
        throw new SocketTimeoutException("Timeout reached: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (IllegalBlockingModeException e) {
        throw new IllegalBlockingModeException("Socket channel is in non-blocking mode: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error accepting connection: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    // Write the previously read data to the new socket's output stream
    OutputStream outputStream = null;
    try {
        outputStream = serverModeSocket.getOutputStream();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error creating output stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    try {
        if (buffer != null) {
            outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            outputStream.flush();
        } else {
            throw new NullPointerException("Byte array is null");
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error writing to output stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    return serverModeSocket;
}
```

This updated method includes error checking and exception handling for various scenarios, such as when creating the input stream, checking the socket status, reading from the input stream, setting the SO_REUSEADDR option, binding the server socket, accepting a connection, creating the output stream, and writing to the output stream. It throws the appropriate exceptions if any of these scenarios fail.
