Please write a java method that Builds the stream, transitioning this builder to the built state.
Here's an example Java method that builds a stream:

```
public Stream<String> buildStream(List<String> list) {
    Stream.Builder<String> builder = Stream.builder();
    for (String s : list) {
        builder.add(s);
    }
    return builder.build();
}
```

This method takes a list of strings as input and builds a stream using a `Stream.Builder`. It loops through the list and adds each string to the builder using the `add` method. Finally, it calls the `build` method to transition the builder to the built state and return the resulting stream.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the builder has already transitioned to the built state for java.util.stream.Stream.Builder.build() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state before calling the `build` method. If the builder has already been built, it throws an `IllegalStateException`:

```
public Stream<String> buildStream(List<String> list) {
    Stream.Builder<String> builder = Stream.builder();
    for (String s : list) {
        builder.add(s);
    }
    if (builder.build().isParallel()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Builder has already been built");
    }
    return builder.build();
}
```

This method first builds the stream and checks if it is parallel using the `isParallel` method. If it is parallel, it means that the builder has already been built and an `IllegalStateException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method returns the built stream.

    try {
        return builder.build();
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Builder has already been built");
    }
}
```

This method tries to build the stream using the `build` method and catches any `IllegalStateException` that may be thrown if the builder has already been built. If an exception is caught, it throws a new `IllegalStateException` with a custom message. Otherwise, the method returns the built stream.
