Please write a java method that Acquires a permit from this semaphore, if one becomes available within the given waiting time and the current thread has not been interrupted.
Here's an example Java method that acquires a permit from a semaphore within a given waiting time:

```
public boolean acquireSemaphore(Semaphore semaphore, long timeout) {
    try {
        return semaphore.tryAcquire(timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        return false;
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Semaphore` object and a `timeout` value in milliseconds as parameters. It tries to acquire a permit from the semaphore within the given waiting time using the `tryAcquire()` method with the timeout and time unit parameters. If a permit is acquired, the method returns `true`. If the current thread is interrupted while waiting for a permit, the method sets the thread's interrupted status and returns `false`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread cannot modify this thread for java.lang.Thread.interrupt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the target thread's interrupt status before calling `Thread.interrupt()`. If the current thread is not allowed to modify the target thread, a `SecurityException` is thrown:

```
public boolean acquireSemaphore(Semaphore semaphore, long timeout) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkAccess(Thread.currentThread());
    }
    try {
        return semaphore.tryAcquire(timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        return false;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed and if so, calls its `checkAccess()` method to determine if the current thread is allowed to modify the target thread's interrupt status. If the current thread is not allowed to modify the target thread, a `SecurityException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method proceeds with trying to acquire a permit from the semaphore as before.
