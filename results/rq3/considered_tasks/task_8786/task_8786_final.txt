Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the target thread's interrupt status before calling `Thread.interrupt()`. If the current thread is not allowed to modify the target thread, a `SecurityException` is thrown:

```
public boolean acquireSemaphore(Semaphore semaphore, long timeout) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkAccess(Thread.currentThread());
    }
    try {
        return semaphore.tryAcquire(timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        return false;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed and if so, calls its `checkAccess()` method to determine if the current thread is allowed to modify the target thread's interrupt status. If the current thread is not allowed to modify the target thread, a `SecurityException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method proceeds with trying to acquire a permit from the semaphore as before.
