The updated Java method I provided earlier already checks if the status could not be determined for `javax.smartcardio.CardTerminal.isCardPresent()` and throws a `CardException` in that case. Here's the relevant part of the code:

```java
cardPresent = cardTerminal.isCardPresent();
if (!cardTerminal.isCardPresent() && cardPresent) {
    throw new CardException("Could not determine card status");
}
```

This code checks if the card is present before and after the sleep time to ensure that the status could be determined. If the status could not be determined, it throws a `CardException` with an appropriate message.
