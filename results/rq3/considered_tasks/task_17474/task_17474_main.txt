Please write a java method that Undoes all changes made in the current transaction made prior to the given Savepoint object.
Here's an example Java method that undoes all changes made in the current transaction prior to the given Savepoint object:

```java
public void rollbackToSavepoint(Savepoint savepoint) throws SQLException {
    Connection conn = null;
    Savepoint currentSavepoint = null;
    try {
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
        conn.setAutoCommit(false);
        currentSavepoint = conn.setSavepoint();
        // Perform some database operations here
        // ...
        // Rollback to the given savepoint
        conn.rollback(savepoint);
        conn.commit();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (conn != null) {
            try {
                conn.rollback(currentSavepoint);
                conn.commit();
            } catch (SQLException ex) {
                ex.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.close();
        }
    }
}
```

In this method, we first establish a connection to the database and set the auto-commit mode to false. We then create a new savepoint using the `setSavepoint()` method. We perform some database operations, and if an exception occurs, we rollback to the current savepoint and commit the changes. If the exception is not caught, we rollback to the given savepoint and commit the changes. Finally, we close the connection.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs, this method is called while participating in a distributed transaction, this method is called on a closed connection            or this Connection object is currently in            auto commit mode for java.sql.Connection.setSavepoint() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.Connection.setSavepoint() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Here's the updated Java method that checks for the mentioned exceptions and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```java
public void rollbackToSavepoint(Savepoint savepoint) throws SQLException {
    Connection conn = null;
    Savepoint currentSavepoint = null;
    try {
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        if (conn.getAutoCommit()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is in auto-commit mode");
        }
        conn.setAutoCommit(false);
        currentSavepoint = conn.setSavepoint();
        // Perform some database operations here
        // ...
        // Rollback to the given savepoint
        conn.rollback(savepoint);
        conn.commit();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (conn != null) {
            try {
                conn.rollback(currentSavepoint);
                conn.commit();
            } catch (SQLException ex) {
                ex.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        e.printStackTrace();
        throw e;
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported", e);
    } finally {
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.close();
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated method, we first check if the connection is closed or in auto-commit mode. If either of these conditions is true, we throw a `SQLException`. We then proceed with the rest of the method as before. If a `SQLException` or `UnsupportedOperationException` occurs, we catch it, print the stack trace, and re-throw the exception. Finally, we close the connection.
