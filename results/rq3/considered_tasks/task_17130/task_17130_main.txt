Please write a java method that Returns the type of this RowSet object.
Here's a Java method that returns the type of a RowSet object:

```java
public String getRowSetType(RowSet rowSet) {
    int type = rowSet.getType();
    switch (type) {
        case ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY:
            return "TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY";
        case ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE:
            return "TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE";
        case ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE:
            return "TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE";
        default:
            return "Unknown RowSet type";
    }
}
```

This method takes a RowSet object as a parameter and returns a String representing the type of the RowSet. It uses the getType() method of the RowSet interface to get the type of the RowSet and then uses a switch statement to return the appropriate String representation of the type. If the type is not recognized, it returns "Unknown RowSet type".

Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.getType() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and closed result sets and throws SQLException if necessary:

```java
public String getRowSetType(RowSet rowSet) throws SQLException {
    try {
        int type = rowSet.getType();
        switch (type) {
            case ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY:
                return "TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY";
            case ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE:
                return "TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE";
            case ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE:
                return "TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE";
            default:
                return "Unknown RowSet type";
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0 || e.getSQLState().equals("S1000")) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred or this method was called on a closed result set.", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method now includes a try-catch block that catches any SQLException that may occur when calling the getType() method. It then checks the error code and SQL state of the exception to determine if it was caused by a database access error or a closed result set. If so, it throws a new SQLException with a custom error message that includes the original exception as the cause. If the exception was caused by something else, it re-throws the original exception.
