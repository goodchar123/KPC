
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for `IOException`:

```java
public void writeAttribute(DataOutputStream out, String attribute) throws IOException {
    byte[] bytes = attribute.getBytes("UTF-8");
    try {
        out.writeInt(bytes.length);
        out.write(bytes);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error writing attribute to stream", e);
    }
}
```

This method includes a try-catch block around the calls to `writeInt` and `write` to catch any `IOException` that may occur. If an `IOException` is caught, the method throws a new `IOException` with a descriptive error message and the original exception as the cause.

By checking for `IOException`, this method provides more robust error handling and allows the calling code to handle the errors appropriately.
