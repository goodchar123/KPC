Please write a java method that Writes a stream of bytes representing a MIDI file of the file type indicated to the external file provided.
Here's an example Java method that writes a stream of bytes representing a MIDI file of the file type indicated to the external file provided:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class MidiFileWriter {
    public static void writeMidiFile(byte[] data, String filename) throws IOException {
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(filename);
        fos.write(data);
        fos.close();
    }
}
```

This method takes in a byte array `data` representing the MIDI file, and a `filename` string indicating the name of the external file to write to. It uses a `FileOutputStream` to write the byte array to the file, and then closes the stream. 

You can call this method with the appropriate arguments to write a MIDI file to an external file:

```java
byte[] midiData = // get MIDI data from somewhere
String filename = "myMidiFile.mid";
MidiFileWriter.writeMidiFile(midiData, filename);
```
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.FileOutputStream.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error when closing the `FileOutputStream` and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class MidiFileWriter {
    public static void writeMidiFile(byte[] data, String filename) throws IOException {
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(filename);
        try {
            fos.write(data);
        } finally {
            try {
                fos.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error closing file output stream", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a `try-finally` block to ensure that the `FileOutputStream` is closed even if an exception is thrown while writing the data. The `finally` block checks for an `IOException` when closing the stream, and throws a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message if one occurs. 

You can call this method with the appropriate arguments to write a MIDI file to an external file and handle any potential `IOExceptions`:

```java
byte[] midiData = // get MIDI data from somewhere
String filename = "myMidiFile.mid";
try {
    MidiFileWriter.writeMidiFile(midiData, filename);
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle the exception
}
```
