Please write a java method that Sets the particular property in the underlying implementation of XMLReader.
Here's an example Java method that sets a property in the underlying implementation of XMLReader:

```java
import org.xml.sax.XMLReader;
import org.xml.sax.SAXException;

public void setXMLReaderProperty(XMLReader reader, String property, Object value) throws SAXException {
    reader.setProperty(property, value);
}
```

This method takes an `XMLReader` object, a property name as a `String`, and a value for the property as an `Object`. It then calls the `setProperty` method on the `XMLReader` object, passing in the property name and value.

Note that this method may throw a `SAXException` if the underlying implementation of `XMLReader` does not support the specified property.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If the property            value can't be assigned or retrieved. for org.xml.sax.XMLReader.setProperty(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SAXNotRecognizedException.
Please check When the            XMLReader recognizes the property name but            cannot set the requested value. for org.xml.sax.XMLReader.setProperty(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SAXNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned:

```java
import org.xml.sax.XMLReader;
import org.xml.sax.SAXException;
import org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException;
import org.xml.sax.SAXNotSupportedException;

public void setXMLReaderProperty(XMLReader reader, String property, Object value) throws SAXException {
    try {
        reader.setProperty(property, value);
    } catch (SAXNotRecognizedException e) {
        throw new SAXNotRecognizedException("Property not recognized: " + property);
    } catch (SAXNotSupportedException e) {
        throw new SAXNotSupportedException("Property not supported: " + property);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new SAXException("Error setting property: " + property, e);
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch the exceptions that may be thrown when setting the property. If the property is not recognized, it throws a `SAXNotRecognizedException` with a message indicating the property name. If the property is not supported, it throws a `SAXNotSupportedException` with a similar message. If any other exception is thrown, it throws a generic `SAXException` with a message indicating the property name and the underlying exception.

Note that this method still takes an `XMLReader` object, a property name as a `String`, and a value for the property as an `Object`. It still calls the `setProperty` method on the `XMLReader` object, but now it handles the exceptions that may be thrown.
