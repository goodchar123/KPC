Please write a java method that Send one byte of urgent data on the socket.
Here's an example Java method that sends one byte of urgent data on a socket:

```java
public void sendUrgentData(Socket socket, byte data) throws IOException {
    // Set the socket's urgent data pointer to 1 byte before the end of the send buffer
    socket.sendUrgentData(0xFF);

    // Send the urgent data byte
    OutputStream out = socket.getOutputStream();
    out.write(data);
    out.flush();
}
```

This method takes a `Socket` object and a `byte` of data as parameters. It first sets the socket's urgent data pointer to 1 byte before the end of the send buffer by calling the `sendUrgentData()` method with a value of `0xFF`. This tells the operating system to send any pending data before the urgent data byte.

Then, the method writes the urgent data byte to the socket's output stream using a standard `OutputStream` object. Finally, it flushes the output stream to ensure that the data is sent immediately.

Note that this method may throw an `IOException` if there is an error sending the data on the socket. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when creating the               output stream or if the socket is not connected. for java.net.Socket.getOutputStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.OutputStream.flush() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for I/O errors when creating the output stream and flushing the data:

```java
public void sendUrgentData(Socket socket, byte data) throws IOException {
    // Set the socket's urgent data pointer to 1 byte before the end of the send buffer
    socket.sendUrgentData(0xFF);

    // Send the urgent data byte
    OutputStream out = null;
    try {
        out = socket.getOutputStream();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error creating output stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    try {
        out.write(data);
        out.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error sending urgent data: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first declare the `OutputStream` object as `null` and then try to create it using the `getOutputStream()` method. If an `IOException` occurs during this process, we catch it and throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message.

Similarly, when we write the urgent data byte and flush the output stream, we wrap the code in a try-catch block and catch any `IOException` that occurs. If an exception is caught, we throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message.

By doing this, we can provide more detailed error messages to the caller of the `sendUrgentData()` method, which can help with debugging and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
