I apologize for the confusion earlier. Checking if the current thread is allowed to modify another thread's interrupt status is not possible in Java. The `SecurityException` is only thrown if the current thread is not allowed to modify its own interrupt status.

Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify its own interrupt status using `Thread.interrupt()`, and throws a `SecurityException` if it is not allowed:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.LockInterruptedException;

public class ExampleClass {
    private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void acquireLock() throws LockInterruptedException, InterruptedException, SecurityException {
        try {
            lock.lockInterruptibly();
        } catch
