Please write a java method that Sets the logging object to be used by the SyncProvider implementation provided by the SyncFactory.
Here's a Java method that sets the logging object to be used by the SyncProvider implementation provided by the SyncFactory:

```java
public void setSyncProviderLogging(Logger logger) throws SyncFactoryException {
    SyncFactory factory = SyncFactory.getInstance();
    factory.setLogger(logger);
}
```

This method first gets an instance of the SyncFactory using the `getInstance()` method. It then sets the logger object using the `setLogger()` method provided by the SyncFactory. If any exception occurs during this process, it throws a `SyncFactoryException`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a security manager exists and its   checkPermission method denies calling setLogger for javax.sql.rowset.spi.SyncFactory.setLogger(java.util.logging.Logger) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check if the logger is null for javax.sql.rowset.spi.SyncFactory.setLogger(java.util.logging.Logger) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Here's the updated Java method that checks for a security manager and null logger object before setting the logging object to be used by the SyncProvider implementation provided by the SyncFactory:

```java
public void setSyncProviderLogging(Logger logger) throws SyncFactoryException, SecurityException, NullPointerException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("setFactory"));
    }
    if (logger == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Logger object cannot be null");
    }
    SyncFactory factory = SyncFactory.getInstance();
    factory.setLogger(logger);
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager exists and if it does, it checks if the `setFactory` permission is granted using the `checkPermission()` method. If the logger object is null, it throws a `NullPointerException`. If everything is fine, it gets an instance of the SyncFactory using the `getInstance()` method and sets the logger object using the `setLogger()` method provided by the SyncFactory. If any exception occurs during this process, it throws a `SyncFactoryException`.
