
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested error handling:

```java
public static void getUDTHierarchyDescription(String schemaName) throws ClassNotFoundException, LinkageError, ExceptionInInitializerError, SQLException, SQLTimeoutException {
    // Load the JDBC driver
    try {
        Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
    } catch (InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException | NoSuchMethodException | InvocationTargetException e) {
        throw new ExceptionInInitializerError(e);
    } catch (LinkageError e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
        throw e;
    }

    // Connect to the database
    Connection conn = null;
    try {
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");
        conn.setLoginTimeout(10);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLTimeoutException(e);
    }

    // Create a statement object
    Statement stmt = null;
    try {
        stmt = conn.createStatement();
        stmt.setQueryTimeout(10);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLTimeoutException(e);
    }

    // Execute the query to retrieve the UDT hierarchy description
    String query = "SELECT TYPE_NAME, SUPERTYPE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TYPE_HIERARCHY WHERE OBJECT_SCHEMA = '" + schemaName + "'";
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLTimeoutException(e);
    }

    // Print the UDT hierarchy description
    while (rs.next()) {
        String typeName = null;
        String superTypeName = null;
        try {
            typeName = rs.getString("TYPE_NAME");
            superTypeName = rs.getString("SUPERTYPE_NAME");
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Invalid column label or result set is closed", e);
        }
        System.out.println("Type Name: " + typeName + ", Super Type Name: " + superTypeName);
    }

    // Close the result set, statement, and connection
    try {
        rs.close();
        stmt.close();
        conn.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This method now includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the linkage fails for `Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver")`, a `LinkageError` is thrown.
- If the initialization provoked by `Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver")` fails, an `ExceptionInInitializerError` is thrown.
- If the class cannot be located for `Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver")`, a `ClassNotFoundException` is thrown.
- If the driver has determined that the timeout value specified by the `setLoginTimeout` method has been exceeded and has at least tried to cancel the current database connection attempt, a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown.
- If the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the `setQueryTimeout` method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running `Statement`, a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown.
- If the column label is not valid or a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for `ResultSet.getString(String)`, a `SQLException` is thrown.
- If a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for `ResultSet.next()`, a `SQLException` is thrown.
