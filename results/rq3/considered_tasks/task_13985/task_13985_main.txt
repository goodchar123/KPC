Please write a java method that Returns the week year represented by this Calendar.
Sure, here's a Java method that returns the week year represented by a given Calendar object:

```java
public static int getWeekYear(Calendar calendar) {
    return calendar.getWeekYear();
}
```

This method simply calls the `getWeekYear()` method on the given `Calendar` object and returns the result as an `int`. Note that the `getWeekYear()` method was introduced in Java 8, so if you're using an earlier version of Java, you'll need to use a different approach to get the week year.

Please check if any week year numbering isn't supported            in this Calendar. for java.util.Calendar.getWeekYear() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the week year numbering is supported by the given `Calendar` object:

```java
public static int getWeekYear(Calendar calendar) {
    int weekYear = calendar.getWeekYear();
    if (weekYear == 0) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Week year numbering not supported");
    }
    return weekYear;
}
```

This method first calls the `getWeekYear()` method on the given `Calendar` object to get the week year. If the week year is 0, it means that the week year numbering is not supported by the `Calendar`, so the method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. Otherwise, the method returns the week year as an `int`.
