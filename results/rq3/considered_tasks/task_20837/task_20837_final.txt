
Sure, here's an updated version of the `setParameter` method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the statement if it has exceeded the timeout value:

```java
public void setParameter(String parameterName, String parameterValue, int queryTimeout) throws SQLException {
    try {
        PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("UPDATE my_table SET my_column = ? WHERE id = ?");
        ps.setString(1, parameterValue);
        ps.setInt(2, 1234); // example ID value
        ps.setQueryTimeout(queryTimeout);
        ps.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            // timeout occurred, attempt to cancel the statement
            ps.cancel();
        }
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This version of the method takes an additional parameter `queryTimeout` which specifies the maximum number of seconds that the statement should be allowed to run before timing out. The `setQueryTimeout` method is called on the prepared statement to set this value.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown during the execution of the statement, the method catches it and attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel` method. If the statement cannot be cancelled for some reason, the exception is re-thrown to the calling code.

Note that this implementation assumes that the `ps` variable is in scope and accessible from the catch block. If this is not the case in your specific implementation, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
