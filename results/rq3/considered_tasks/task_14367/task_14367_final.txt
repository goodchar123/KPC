Sure, here's an updated version of the `main` method that checks if the array contains elements that are not mutually comparable using the specified comparator and if the comparator violates the `Comparator` contract. If either of these conditions is true, it throws a `ClassCastException` or `IllegalArgumentException`, respectively:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] words = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"};

        // Sort by second character of word
        Comparator<String> secondCharComparator = SortByKey.sortByCharAt(1);

        // Check if array contains elements that are not mutually comparable
        for (String word : words) {
            if (!(word instanceof Comparable)) {
                throw new ClassCastException("Array contains elements that are not mutually comparable");
            }
        }

        // Check if comparator violates Comparator contract
        if (secondCharComparator.compare("apple", "banana") > 0 && secondCharComparator.compare("banana", "apple") > 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Comparator violates Comparator contract");
        }

        Arrays.sort(words, secondCharComparator);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words)); // [banana, apple, elderberry, cherry, date]
    }
}
```

This updated version of the `main` method first checks if the array contains elements that are not mutually comparable by iterating over the array and checking if each element is an instance of `Comparable`. If any element is not mutually comparable, it throws a `ClassCastException` with a message indicating that the array contains elements that are not mutually comparable.

Next, it checks if the comparator violates the `Comparator` contract by comparing two elements in opposite order and checking if the results are consistent. If the comparator violates the contract, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the comparator violates the `Comparator` contract.

Finally, if neither of these conditions is true, it sorts the `words` array using the `Arrays.sort()` method with the `secondCharComparator` comparator and prints the sorted array.

Note that the check for elements that are not mutually comparable is optional, as the `Arrays.sort()` method will throw a `ClassCastException` if the array contains elements that are not mutually comparable. However, performing this check explicitly can provide more informative error messages.
