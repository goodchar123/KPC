
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the null and bounds checks you requested:

```java
public static void readBytes(InputStream stream, byte[] b) throws IOException {
    if (b == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("byte array is null");
    }
    int bytesRead = 0;
    while (bytesRead < b.length) {
        int count = stream.read(b, bytesRead, b.length - bytesRead);
        if (count == -1) {
            break;
        }
        bytesRead += count;
    }
    if (bytesRead < b.length) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("not enough bytes available in stream");
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the byte array `b` is null, and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. It then proceeds with the same logic as before, reading bytes from the stream and storing them in `b`. After the loop completes, the method checks if the number of bytes read is less than the length of `b`, and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if it is. This ensures that the entire byte array is filled with data from the stream. Additionally, the method checks if the `off` and `len` parameters passed to `InputStream.read` are valid, but this is already handled by the `read` method itself and will throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if they are not valid.
