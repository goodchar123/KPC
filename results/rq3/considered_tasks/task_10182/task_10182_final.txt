You're right, it's important to add those checks to ensure the method is robust. Here's the updated Java method that includes those checks:

```java
public void readBytes(InputStream inputStream, byte[] buffer, int numBytes) throws IOException {
    if (buffer == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Buffer cannot be null");
    }
    if (numBytes < 0 || buffer.length < numBytes) {
        throw new
