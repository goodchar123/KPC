Please write a java method that Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next invocation of a method for this input stream.
Here's a Java method that returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from an input stream without blocking by the next invocation of a method for this input stream:

```java
public int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    // Get the number of bytes that can be read without blocking
    int available = inputStream.available();

    // If the available bytes is zero, try to read one byte to see if any bytes are available
    if (available == 0) {
        inputStream.mark(1);
        if (inputStream.read() != -1) {
            available = 1;
        }
        inputStream.reset();
    }

    return available;
}
```

This method first checks the number of bytes that can be read without blocking using the `available()` method of the `InputStream` class. If the available bytes is zero, it tries to read one byte using the `read()` method. If the `read()` method returns `-1`, it means that there are no bytes available for reading, so the method returns zero. Otherwise, it resets the input stream to its original position using the `reset()` method and returns one as the number of available bytes.

Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.InputStream.available() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.InputStream.read() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if this stream has not been marked or if the          mark has been invalidated. for java.io.InputStream.reset() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for I/O errors and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
public int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    // Get the number of bytes that can be read without blocking
    int available = inputStream.available();

    // If the available bytes is zero, try to read one byte to see if any bytes are available
    if (available == 0) {
        inputStream.mark(1);
        int readByte = inputStream.read();
        if (readByte != -1) {
            available = 1;
        }
        inputStream.reset();
    }

    return available;
}
```

For the `available()` method, we can simply add a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur:

```java
public int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        // Get the number of bytes that can be read without blocking
        int available = inputStream.available();

        // If the available bytes is zero, try to read one byte to see if any bytes are available
        if (available == 0) {
            inputStream.mark(1);
            int readByte = inputStream.read();
            if (readByte != -1) {
                available = 1;
            }
            inputStream.reset();
        }

        return available;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while checking available bytes", e);
    }
}
```

For the `read()` method, we can also add a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur:

```java
public int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        // Get the number of bytes that can be read without blocking
        int available = inputStream.available();

        // If the available bytes is zero, try to read one byte to see if any bytes are available
        if (available == 0) {
            inputStream.mark(1);
            int readByte = inputStream.read();
            if (readByte != -1) {
                available = 1;
            }
            inputStream.reset();
        }

        return available;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while checking available bytes", e);
    }
}

```

For the `reset()` method, we can add an `if` statement to check if the stream has been marked or if the mark has been invalidated:

```java
public int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        // Get the number of bytes that can be read without blocking
        int available = inputStream.available();

        // If the available bytes is zero, try to read one byte to see if any bytes are available
        if (available == 0) {
            inputStream.mark(1);
            int readByte = inputStream.read();
            if (readByte != -1) {
                available = 1;
            }
            if (inputStream.markSupported()) {
                inputStream.reset();
            } else {
                throw new IOException("Mark/reset not supported");
            }
        }

        return available;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while checking available bytes", e);
    }
}
```

This code checks if the stream has been marked and if the mark is still valid using the `markSupported()` method. If the mark is not supported, it throws an `IOException`. Otherwise, it calls the `reset()` method to reset the stream to its marked position.

        return available;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while checking available bytes", e);
    }
}
```

For the `available()` method, we can simply add a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur:

```java
public int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        // Get the number of bytes that can be read without blocking
        int available = inputStream.available();

        // If the available bytes is zero, try to read one byte to see if any bytes are available
        if (available == 0) {
            inputStream.mark(1);
            int readByte = inputStream.read();
            if (readByte != -1) {
                available = 1;
            }
            inputStream.reset();
        }

        return available;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while checking available bytes", e);
    }
}
```

For the `read()` method, we can also add a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur:

```java
public int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        // Get the number of bytes that can be read without blocking
        int available = inputStream.available();

        // If the available bytes is zero, try to read one byte to see if any bytes are available
        if (available == 0) {
            inputStream.mark(1);
            int readByte = inputStream.read();
            if (readByte != -1) {
                available = 1;
            }
            inputStream.reset();
        }

        return available;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while checking available bytes", e);
    }
}
```

This code checks for any `IOException` that may occur while calling the `available()` and `read()` methods, and throws a new `IOException` with a descriptive message and the original exception as its cause.
