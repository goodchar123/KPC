Please write a java method that Returns the number of bytes that can be read without blocking.
Here's a Java method that returns the number of bytes that can be read without blocking:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class InputStreamHelper {
    public static int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
        return inputStream.available();
    }
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as an argument and returns the number of bytes that can be read from the stream without blocking. It does this by calling the `available()` method on the `InputStream`, which returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read from the stream without blocking.

Note that the `available()` method may not always return an accurate value, as it is only an estimate. Additionally, some types of `InputStreams` may not support the `available()` method, in which case this method would not work.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.InputStream.available() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error when calling `available()` and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class InputStreamHelper {
    public static int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
        int available = inputStream.available();
        if (available < 0) {
            throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while checking available bytes");
        }
        return available;
    }
}
```

This updated method first calls `available()` to get the number of bytes that can be read without blocking. It then checks if the returned value is negative, which indicates that an I/O error occurred. If an error occurred, it throws an `IOException` with a message indicating that an error occurred. Otherwise, it returns the number of available bytes.

By checking for an I/O error and throwing an exception if one occurs, this method provides more robust error handling than the previous version.
