Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes error checking and exception handling for the `next()` and `remove()` methods of the iterator:

```java
public void selectKeys() throws IOException {
    Selector selector = null;
    try {
        selector = Selector.open();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error opening selector", e);
    }
    
    // Register channels with selector
    try {
        channel1.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);
        channel2.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_WRITE);
        channel3.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ | SelectionKey.OP_WRITE);
    } catch (ClosedChannelException e) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException("Channel is closed", e);
    } catch (ClosedSelectorException e) {
        throw new ClosedSelectorException("Selector is closed", e);
    } catch (IllegalBlockingModeException e) {
        throw new IllegalBlockingModeException("Channel is in blocking mode", e);
    } catch (IllegalSelectorException e) {
        throw new IllegalSelectorException("Channel was not created by the same provider as the given selector", e);
    } catch (CancelledKeyException e) {
        throw new CancelledKeyException("Channel is already registered with the given selector but the corresponding key has already been cancelled", e);
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Ops does not correspond to a supported operation", e);
    }
    
    // Select keys whose channels are ready for I/O operations
    while (true) {
        int readyChannels = 0;
        try {
            readyChannels = selector.select();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error selecting keys", e);
        }
        
        if (readyChannels == 0) {
            continue;
        }
        
        Set<SelectionKey> selectedKeys = null;
        try {
            selectedKeys = selector.selectedKeys();
        } catch (ClosedSelectorException e) {
            throw new ClosedSelectorException("Selector is closed", e);
        }
        
        Iterator<SelectionKey> keyIterator = selectedKeys.iterator();
        
        while (keyIterator.hasNext()) {
            SelectionKey key = null;
            try {
                key = keyIterator.next();
            } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
                throw new NoSuchElementException("No more elements in iterator", e);
            }
            
            try {
                if (key.isReadable()) {
                    if (key.isValid()) {
                        // Handle read operation
                    } else {
                        throw new CancelledKeyException("Key has been cancelled");
                    }
                } else if (key.isWritable()) {
                    if (key.isValid()) {
                        // Handle write operation
                    } else {
                        throw new CancelledKeyException("Key has been cancelled");
                    }
                }
            } catch (CancelledKeyException e) {
                keyIterator.remove();
                throw e;
            }
            
            try {
                keyIterator.remove();
            } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Remove operation not supported by iterator", e);
            } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Next method has not been called, or remove method has already been called after the last call to the next method", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we use try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions that may occur when calling the `next()` and `remove()` methods of the iterator, and throw a `NoSuchElementException` if there are no more elements in the iterator, a `UnsupportedOperationException` if the remove operation is not supported by the iterator, or a `IllegalStateException` if the remove method has already been called after the last call to the next method. We also use try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions that may occur when selecting keys or removing them from the selected set.
