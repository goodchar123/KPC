
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the calling thread's permission to create modal dialogs with the given modality type:

```java
public void setDialogModalityType(Dialog dialog, ModalityType modalityType) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new AWTPermission("createModalDialog"));
    }
    dialog.setModalityType(modalityType);
}
```

This method first checks if there is a `SecurityManager` installed in the system. If there is, it calls the `checkPermission` method of the `SecurityManager` object to check if the calling thread has permission to create modal dialogs with the given modality type. If the permission is not granted, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If there is no `SecurityManager` installed, the method simply calls the `setModalityType` method of the `Dialog` object to set the modality type.
