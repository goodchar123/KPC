Please write a java method that Sets the modality type for this dialog.
Here's an example Java method that sets the modality type for a dialog:

```java
public void setDialogModalityType(Dialog dialog, ModalityType modalityType) {
    dialog.setModalityType(modalityType);
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the `Dialog` object that you want to set the modality type for, and the `ModalityType` value that you want to set. You can call this method with any `Dialog` object and any `ModalityType` value to set the modality type for that dialog.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the calling thread does not have permission     to create modal dialogs with the given modalityType for java.awt.Dialog.setModalityType(java.awt.Dialog.ModalityType) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the calling thread's permission to create modal dialogs with the given modality type:

```java
public void setDialogModalityType(Dialog dialog, ModalityType modalityType) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new AWTPermission("createModalDialog"));
    }
    dialog.setModalityType(modalityType);
}
```

This method first checks if there is a `SecurityManager` installed in the system. If there is, it calls the `checkPermission` method of the `SecurityManager` object to check if the calling thread has permission to create modal dialogs with the given modality type. If the permission is not granted, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If there is no `SecurityManager` installed, the method simply calls the `setModalityType` method of the `Dialog` object to set the modality type.
