Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes all the requested checks:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel;
import java.nio.channels.NonWritableChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedByInterruptException;

public void writeToChannel(WritableByteChannel channel, ByteBuffer buffer) throws IOException {
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    if (!(channel instanceof WritableByteChannel)) {
        throw new NonWritableChannelException();
    }
    while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
        try {
            channel.write(buffer);
        } catch (AsynchronousCloseException e) {
            throw new AsynchronousCloseException();
        } catch (ClosedByInterruptException e) {
            throw new ClosedByInterruptException();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException(e);
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the channel is open using the `isOpen()` method. If the channel is closed, it throws a `ClosedChannelException`. It then checks if the channel is writable using the `instanceof` operator. If the channel is not writable, it throws a `NonWritableChannelException`.

During the write operation, the method catches `AsynchronousCloseException` and `ClosedByInterruptException` exceptions and rethrows them with the appropriate exception type. This handles the cases where the channel is closed or interrupted while the write operation is in progress. It also catches `IOException` exceptions and rethrows them with the appropriate exception type.

Note that this method only throws an `IOException` if there is an error while writing to the channel. You can handle this exception in your code as needed.
