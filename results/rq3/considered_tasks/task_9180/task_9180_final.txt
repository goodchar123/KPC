Sure, here's an updated version of the `findNextMatch` method that checks if a match has been attempted or if the previous match operation failed before calling `start()`. If either of these conditions is true, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown:

```java
public static void findNextMatch(String input, String pattern, int startIndex) {
    Pattern p = Pattern.compile(pattern);
    Matcher m = p.matcher(input);
    m.region(startIndex, input.length()); // set the region to start at the specified index
    if (m.find()) {
        System.out.println("Match found at index " + m.start());
    } else {
        System.out.println("No match found.");
    }
    if (m.hitEnd() || m.requireEnd() || m.toMatchResult().hasNext()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No match attempted or previous match operation failed.");
    }
    m.reset(); // reset the matcher
}
```

The `hitEnd()` method checks if the end of the input sequence was hit during the last match operation, `requireEnd()` checks if the pattern requires the end of the input sequence to match, and `toMatchResult().hasNext()` checks if there are any more matches in the input sequence. If any of these conditions are true, it means that no match has been attempted or the previous match operation failed, so an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

You can call this method in the same way as before:

```java
String input = "The quick brown fox jumps over
