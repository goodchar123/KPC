
You are correct, it is good practice to check if the component is null before removing it from the container. Here's the updated code snippet that includes the null check and throws a `NullPointerException` if the component is null:

```java
public void removeComponent(Container container, Component component) {
    if (component == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Component cannot be null");
    }
    container.remove(component);
    container.revalidate();
    container.repaint();
}
```

This updated method first checks if the component is null. If it is null, it throws a `NullPointerException` with a message indicating that the component cannot be null.

If the component is not null, the method proceeds to remove it from the container, revalidates the container's layout, and repaints the container to reflect the updated layout.
