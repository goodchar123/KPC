Please write a java method that Determines if the expired bundle in the cache needs to be reloaded based on the loading time given by loadTime or some other criteria.
Sure, here's an example Java method that determines if an expired bundle in the cache needs to be reloaded based on the loading time:

```
public boolean needsReload(long loadTime, long expirationTime) {
    long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long timeSinceLoad = currentTime - loadTime;
    long timeUntilExpiration = expirationTime - currentTime;
    
    // If the time since load is greater than the time until expiration,
    // the bundle needs to be reloaded
    if (timeSinceLoad > timeUntilExpiration) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Otherwise, the bundle does not need to be reloaded
    return false;
}
```

This method takes in two parameters: `loadTime`, which is the time that the bundle was last loaded into the cache, and `expirationTime`, which is the time at which the bundle is set to expire from the cache. 

The method first calculates the current time using `System.currentTimeMillis()`. It then calculates the time since the bundle was last loaded by subtracting `loadTime` from the current time, and the time until the bundle expires by subtracting the current time from `expirationTime`.

If the time since load is greater than the time until expiration, the method returns `true`, indicating that the bundle needs to be reloaded. Otherwise, the method returns `false`, indicating that the bundle does not need to be reloaded.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the result overflows a long for java.lang.Math.subtractExact(long,long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for overflow using `Math.subtractExact()` and throws an `ArithmeticException` if an overflow occurs:

```
public boolean needsReload(long loadTime, long expirationTime) {
    long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long timeSinceLoad;
    long timeUntilExpiration;
    
    try {
        timeSinceLoad = Math.subtractExact(currentTime, loadTime);
        timeUntilExpiration = Math.subtractExact(expirationTime, currentTime);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Overflow occurred while calculating time since load or time until expiration.");
    }
    
    // If the time since load is greater than the time until expiration,
    // the bundle needs to be reloaded
    if (timeSinceLoad > timeUntilExpiration) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Otherwise, the bundle does not need to be reloaded
    return false;
}
```

This updated version of the method uses `Math.subtractExact()` to calculate `timeSinceLoad` and `timeUntilExpiration`. If an overflow occurs during the calculation, an `ArithmeticException` is thrown with a message indicating that an overflow occurred.

If no overflow occurs, the method proceeds as before, checking if the time since load is greater than the time until expiration and returning `true` or `false` accordingly.
