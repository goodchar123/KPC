Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for overflow using `Math.subtractExact()` and throws an `ArithmeticException` if an overflow occurs:

```
public boolean needsReload(long loadTime, long expirationTime) {
    long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long timeSinceLoad;
    long timeUntilExpiration;
    
    try {
        timeSinceLoad = Math.subtractExact(currentTime, loadTime);
        timeUntilExpiration = Math.subtractExact(expirationTime, currentTime);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Overflow occurred while calculating time since load or time until expiration.");
    }
    
    // If the time since load is greater than the time until expiration,
    // the bundle needs to be reloaded
    if (timeSinceLoad > timeUntilExpiration) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Otherwise, the bundle does not need to be reloaded
    return false;
}
```

This updated version of the method uses `Math.subtractExact()` to calculate `timeSinceLoad` and `timeUntilExpiration`. If an overflow occurs during the calculation, an `ArithmeticException` is thrown with a message indicating that an overflow occurred.

If no overflow occurs, the method proceeds as before, checking if the time since load is greater than the time until expiration and returning `true` or `false` accordingly.
