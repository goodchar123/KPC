Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the offset is invalid and throws a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` if necessary:

```
public void insertObjectToString(Object obj, StringBuilder sb, int offset) {
    if (offset < 0 || offset > sb.length()) {
        throw new StringIndexOutOfBoundsException("Invalid offset: " + offset);
    }
    sb.insert(offset, obj.toString());
}
```

This method takes three arguments: the object to be inserted (as an `Object`), the character sequence to insert it into (as a `StringBuilder`), and the offset at which to insert the object (as an `int`). It first checks if the offset is less than zero or greater than the length of the character sequence, and if so, throws a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` with an appropriate error message. If the offset is valid, it then calls the `toString()` method on the object to get its string representation, and inserts that string at the specified offset using the `insert()` method of the `StringBuilder` class.
