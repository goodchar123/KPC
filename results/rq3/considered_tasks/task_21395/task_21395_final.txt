
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes error handling:

```
public void writeXMLValue(SQLXML sqlxml, OutputStream outputStream) throws SQLException, IOException {
    if (sqlxml == null || outputStream == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("SQLXML and OutputStream cannot be null");
    }
    try {
        OutputStream xmlOutputStream = sqlxml.setBinaryStream();
        if (xmlOutputStream == null) {
            throw new SQLException("SQLXML state is not writable");
        }
        byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
        int bytesRead;
        while ((bytesRead = outputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            xmlOutputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
        }
        xmlOutputStream.close();
        outputStream.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error writing XML value: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the SQLXML and OutputStream parameters are not null. It then tries to retrieve a binary stream from the SQLXML instance using the `setBinaryStream()` method. If the binary stream is null, it throws a SQLException.

The method then reads from the input OutputStream and writes to the binary stream until there is no more data to read. It closes both streams at the end.

If any exceptions are thrown during this process, the method catches them and throws a SQLException or IOException with an appropriate error message.

You can call this updated method like this:

```
SQLXML sqlxml = resultSet.getSQLXML("xml_column");
OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.xml");
try {
    writeXMLValue(sqlxml, outputStream);
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // handle SQLException
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle IOException
} finally {
    sqlxml.free();
    outputStream.close();
}
```

This will retrieve the XML value from the "xml_column" column in the ResultSet and write it to a file named "output.xml". It also frees the SQLXML instance and closes the OutputStream in a finally block to ensure proper cleanup.
