Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error and throws a `SocketException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.net.NetworkInterface;
import java.net.SocketException;

public static boolean isPointToPointInterface(NetworkInterface networkInterface) throws SocketException {
    try {
        return networkInterface.isPointToPoint();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new SocketException("Error checking interface type: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method now catches any `Exception` that may occur while checking the interface type using `isPointToPoint()`. If an exception is caught, it throws a `SocketException` with a message indicating the error. 

Note that we're now only throwing a `SocketException` instead of a generic `Exception`. This is because `SocketException` is a more specific exception type that's commonly used for network-related errors.
