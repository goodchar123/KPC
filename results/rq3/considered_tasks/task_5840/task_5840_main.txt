Please write a java method that Returns whether a network interface is a point to point interface.
Here's a Java method that returns whether a network interface is a point-to-point interface:

```java
import java.net.NetworkInterface;

public static boolean isPointToPointInterface(NetworkInterface networkInterface) throws Exception {
    return networkInterface.isPointToPoint();
}
```

This method takes a `NetworkInterface` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the interface is a point-to-point interface. The `isPointToPoint()` method of the `NetworkInterface` class returns `true` if the interface is a point-to-point interface, and `false` otherwise. 

Note that this method throws an `Exception` if there is an error while checking the interface type. You may want to handle this exception appropriately in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.net.NetworkInterface.isPointToPoint() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SocketException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error and throws a `SocketException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.net.NetworkInterface;
import java.net.SocketException;

public static boolean isPointToPointInterface(NetworkInterface networkInterface) throws SocketException {
    try {
        return networkInterface.isPointToPoint();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new SocketException("Error checking interface type: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method now catches any `Exception` that may occur while checking the interface type using `isPointToPoint()`. If an exception is caught, it throws a `SocketException` with a message indicating the error. 

Note that we're now only throwing a `SocketException` instead of a generic `Exception`. This is because `SocketException` is a more specific exception type that's commonly used for network-related errors.
