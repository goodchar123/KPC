
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors, closed connections, and query timeouts:

```java
public void setColumnType(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, int sqlType) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    String query = "ALTER TABLE " + tableName + " MODIFY " + columnName + " " + getSqlTypeName(sqlType);
    try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {
        stmt.setQueryTimeout(10); // set query timeout to 10 seconds
        int rowsAffected = stmt.executeUpdate(query);
        if (rowsAffected == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("Column not found or no rows affected");
        }
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}

private String getSqlTypeName(int sqlType) {
    // same as before
}
```

This updated code first checks if the connection is closed and throws a `SQLException` if it is. It then constructs the `ALTER TABLE` query and creates a `Statement` object. It sets the query timeout to 10 seconds using the `setQueryTimeout` method. If the query takes longer than 10 seconds to execute, a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown. If the query executes successfully but no rows are affected, a `SQLException` is thrown with a message indicating that the column was not found or no rows were affected. If a database access error occurs, a `SQLException` is thrown with a message indicating that a database access error occurred and the original exception is included as the cause. If any other `SQLException` is thrown, it is re-thrown as is.
