
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for a database access error, a closed Statement, or unsupported batch updates for `clearBatch()` method:

```java
public void clearBatch(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    try {
        if (stmt.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Statement is closed.");
        }
        stmt.clearBatch();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred.", e);
        } else if (e.getErrorCode() == 133) {
            throw new SQLException("Driver does not support batch updates for clearBatch().", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the Statement object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it is closed, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message.

If the Statement object is not closed, the `clearBatch()` method is called. If an exception occurs while calling this method, the method checks the error code of the exception to determine the cause of the error.

If the error code is 0, a database access error occurred. If the error code is 133, the driver does not support batch updates for `clearBatch()`. In both cases, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message and the original exception as the cause.

If the error code is not 0 or 133, the original exception is re-thrown.
