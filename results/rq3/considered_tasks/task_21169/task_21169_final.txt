
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a database access error or a closed result set before calling the `wasNull()` method:

```java
public boolean wasNull(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
    try {
        return rs.wasNull();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the result set is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the result set is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

If the result set is not closed, it calls the `wasNull()` method to retrieve whether the last value read was SQL NULL. If a `SQLException` occurs while calling the `wasNull()` method, it is caught and re-thrown with a more specific message indicating a database access error.

This updated method provides better error handling and helps to ensure that the caller is aware of any issues that may occur while retrieving the last value read from the result set.
