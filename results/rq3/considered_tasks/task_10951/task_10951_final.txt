Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the value of `millis` is negative before calling `Thread.sleep(long)`:

```java
public void writeBytesToChannel(WritableByteChannel channel, ByteBuffer[] buffers, int offset, int length) throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException {
    long bytesWritten = 0;
    while (bytesWritten < length) {
        long bytesTransferred = channel.write(buffers, offset, length);
        if (bytesTransferred == 0) {
            // Handle the case where the channel is non-blocking and no bytes were transferred
            // Wait for the channel to become writable before trying again
            try {
                Thread.sleep(10);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Handle the exception
            }
        }
        bytesWritten += bytesTransferred;
        offset += bytesTransferred;
        length -= bytesTransferred;
    }
}

// Check if the value of millis is negative before calling Thread.sleep(long)
public void sleep(long millis) throws IllegalArgumentException {
    if (millis < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Sleep time cannot be negative");
    }
    try {
        Thread.sleep(millis);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Handle the exception
    }
}
```

I've added an `IllegalArgumentException` to the method signature and added a check to ensure that the value of `millis` is not negative before calling `Thread.sleep(long)`. If the value of `millis` is negative, the method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the sleep time cannot be negative.
