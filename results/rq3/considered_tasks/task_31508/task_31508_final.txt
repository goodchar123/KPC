
You're right, it's important to check if the offset `off` and length `len` are valid before using them in the `read` method. Here's the updated Java method that includes those checks:

```java
public static void readBytes(InputStream stream, byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
    if (b == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("byte array is null");
    }
    if (off < 0 || len < 0 || len > b.length - off) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("offset or length is invalid");
    }
    int bytesRead = 0;
    while (bytesRead < len) {
        int count = stream.read(b, off + bytesRead, len - bytesRead);
        if (count == -1) {
            throw new IOException("end of file reached");
        }
        bytesRead += count;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the byte array `b` is null, and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. It then checks if the offset `off` or length `len` are invalid, and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if they are. It then reads bytes from the input stream and stores them into the byte array starting at index `off`, similar to the previous implementation. Finally, it checks if the first byte cannot be read for any reason other than end of file, or if the input stream has been closed, or if some other I/O error occurs, and throws an `IOException` if any of those conditions are met.
