Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for any SAX exceptions and throws a `SAXException` if necessary:

```java
import org.xml.sax.Attributes;
import org.xml.sax.SAXException;
import org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler;

public class MyHandler extends DefaultHandler {
    
    @Override
    public void startElement(String uri, String localName, String qName, Attributes attributes) throws SAXException {
        try {
            // Your code to handle the start of the element goes here
            System.out.println("Start Element: " + qName);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new SAXException("Error handling start element: " + e.getMessage(), e);
        }
    }
    
}
```

In this updated version, the `startElement` method now includes a `try-catch` block to catch any exceptions that may occur while handling the start of the element. If an exception is caught, a new `SAXException` is thrown with the original exception as the cause.

This is a good practice to follow when working with SAX parsers, as it ensures that any errors are properly handled and reported to the caller.
