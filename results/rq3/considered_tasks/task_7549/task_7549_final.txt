You are correct, it is important to check if the current thread has permission to modify the target thread before calling the `interrupt` method. Here's the updated code snippet that includes the security check:

```java
public static void interruptThread(Thread thread) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkAccess(thread);
    }
    thread.interrupt();
}
```

Now, if the current thread does not have permission to modify the target thread, the method will throw a `SecurityException`. The `checkAccess` method of the `SecurityManager` class is used to perform the security check. If there is no `SecurityManager` installed, the check is skipped.
