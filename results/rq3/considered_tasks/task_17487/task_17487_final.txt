Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error when creating the HttpServer instance using `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer.create()` method and throws an `IOException` if an error occurs:

```java
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;

public class HttpServerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        HttpServer server;
        try {
            server = HttpServer.create();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Failed to create HttpServer instance", e);
        }
        server.bind(new InetSocketAddress(0), 0);
        // server is now created and not bound to any local address/port
    }
}
```

In this updated example, we use a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur when creating the HttpServer instance using `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer.create()` method. If an `IOException` is caught, we throw a new `IOException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause. This way, the caller of this method can handle the exception appropriately.
