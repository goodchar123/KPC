Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the error handling and exception throwing:

```java
public boolean hasDeletedRows(ResultSet resultSet) throws SQLException {
    boolean hasDeletedRows = false;
    try {
        if (resultSet.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
        }
        ResultSetMetaData metaData = resultSet.getMetaData();
        int columnCount = metaData.getColumnCount();
        while (resultSet.next()) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= columnCount; i++) {
                if (resultSet.rowDeleted()) {
                    hasDeletedRows = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (hasDeletedRows) {
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (SQLFeatureNotSupportedException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
    }
    return hasDeletedRows;
}
```

This updated method includes try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the method. 

First, it checks if the result set is closed using the `isClosed()` method and throws a `SQLException` if it is. 

Next, it calls `getMetaData()` to retrieve the metadata for the result set and checks for any database access errors that may occur during this call. If an error occurs, it throws a `SQLException`.

Then, it uses a `while` loop to iterate over each row in the result set and a `for` loop to iterate over each column in the row. It checks if the row has been marked for deletion using the `rowDeleted()` method and sets the `hasDeletedRows` flag to true if it finds any deleted rows. If an error occurs during the `next()` or `rowDeleted()` method calls, it throws a `SQLException`.

Finally, if the JDBC driver does not support the `rowDeleted()` method, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`.
