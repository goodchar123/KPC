Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the current thread has permission to modify the thread name. If it doesn't have permission, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```java
public static void changeThreadName(String name) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
    }
    Thread.currentThread().setName(name);
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager is installed. If there is, it checks if the current thread has permission to modify threads by calling `checkPermission` with a `RuntimePermission` object that represents the permission to modify threads. If the current thread doesn't have permission, it throws a `SecurityException`.

If there is no security manager installed, the method simply sets the name of the current thread to the specified name.

Note that this method assumes that the security manager has been configured to grant or deny the `modifyThread` permission. If the security manager hasn't been configured, it will default to denying the permission, which means that this method will always throw a `SecurityException`.
