You are correct. The `LocalDate.of()` method can throw a `DateTimeException` if the values provided for year, month, and day are out of range or if the day of month is invalid for the month year. Here's an updated version of the method that includes error checking and throws a `DateTimeException` if any of the values are invalid:

```java
import java.time.DateTimeException;
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class DateUtils {
    public static LocalDate getDate(int year, int month, int day) {
        try {
            return LocalDate.of(year, month, day);
        } catch (DateTimeException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid date values: year=" + year + ", month=" + month + ", day=" + day, e);
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown by the `LocalDate.of()` method. If an exception is caught, a new `DateTimeException` is thrown with a message that includes the invalid values and the original exception as the cause. This way, the caller of the method can see exactly what went wrong and where.
