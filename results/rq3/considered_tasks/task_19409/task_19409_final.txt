Here's the updated Java method that checks for a `SecurityManager` and whether the `Card` object has been disposed of:

```
import javax.smartcardio.*;

public static CardChannel getBasicChannel(Card card) throws CardException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new javax.smartcardio.CardPermission(card.getTerminal().getName(), "getBasicChannel"));
    }
    if (card.isValid()) {
        return card.getBasicChannel();
    } else {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Card object has been disposed of");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if a `SecurityManager` exists and if so, checks if the caller has the required permission for `javax.smartcardio.Card.getBasicChannel()`. If the caller does not have the required permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

Next, the method checks if the `Card` object is still valid using the `isValid()` method. If the `Card` object has been disposed of via the `disconnect()` method, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

If both checks pass, the method returns the basic logical channel's `CardChannel` object using the `getBasicChannel()` method of the `Card` class. If there is an error in obtaining the channel, a `CardException` is thrown.
