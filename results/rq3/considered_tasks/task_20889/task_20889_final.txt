
Here's the updated Java method that checks for the mentioned exceptions and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```java
public void removeSavepointAndSubsequent(Savepoint savepoint) throws SQLException, SQLFeatureNotSupportedException {
    Connection conn = null;
    Savepoint currentSavepoint = null;
    try {
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        if (conn.getAutoCommit()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is in auto-commit mode");
        }
        currentSavepoint = conn.setSavepoint();
        if (currentSavepoint.equals(savepoint)) {
            conn.rollback(savepoint);
        } else {
            throw new SQLException("Savepoint not found");
        }
        conn.commit();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.rollback(currentSavepoint);
        }
        throw e;
    } catch (SQLFeatureNotSupportedException e) {
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.close();
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method checks for the following exceptions:

- If the connection is closed, it throws a SQLException with a message indicating that the connection is closed.
- If the connection is in auto-commit mode, it throws a SQLException with a message indicating that the connection is in auto-commit mode.
- If the JDBC driver does not support the setSavepoint() method, it throws a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
- If any other SQLException occurs during the transaction, it rolls back to the current Savepoint and rethrows the exception.
- Finally, it closes the connection.
