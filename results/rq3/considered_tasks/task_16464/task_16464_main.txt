Please write a java method that Acquires the write lock unless the current thread is interrupted.
Here's a Java method that acquires the write lock unless the current thread is interrupted:

```
public void acquireWriteLock() throws InterruptedException {
    try {
        writeLock.lockInterruptibly();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This method uses the `lockInterruptibly()` method of the `ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock` class to acquire the write lock. If the current thread is interrupted while waiting to acquire the lock, the method catches the `InterruptedException`, sets the interrupted flag on the current thread, and re-throws the exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread cannot modify this thread for java.lang.Thread.interrupt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()`. If not, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```
public void acquireWriteLock() throws InterruptedException, SecurityException {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
    }
    try {
        writeLock.lockInterruptibly();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed and if so, checks if the current thread has permission to modify threads. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method proceeds to acquire the write lock as before.
