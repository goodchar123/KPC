Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()`. If not, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```
public void acquireWriteLock() throws InterruptedException, SecurityException {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
    }
    try {
        writeLock.lockInterruptibly();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed and if so, checks if the current thread has permission to modify threads. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method proceeds to acquire the write lock as before.
