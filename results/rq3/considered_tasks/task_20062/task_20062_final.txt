
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if an `IOException` occurs while calling the `force()` method. If an `IOException` occurs, it throws the exception:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.MappedByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;

public static void forceMappedSegment(MappedByteBuffer mappedSegment) throws ClosedChannelException, IOException {
    FileChannel channel = mappedSegment.getChannel();
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    try {
        channel.force(true);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the channel is open using the `isOpen()` method. If the channel is closed, it throws a `ClosedChannelException`. If the channel is open, it calls the `force()` method on the `FileChannel` object, passing `true` as an argument to indicate that all changes made to the file should be written to the storage device immediately.

If an `IOException` occurs while calling the `force()` method, it throws the exception. If any other exception occurs, it is caught and printed to the console using the `printStackTrace()` method.

Note that this method now throws both `ClosedChannelException` and `IOException`, so any code calling this method will need to handle both exceptions.
