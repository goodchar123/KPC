
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a database access error or a closed Statement object before retrieving the default fetch size for ResultSet objects:

```java
public int getDefaultFetchSize(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    if (stmt.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed.");
    }
    try {
        return stmt.getFetchSize();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the Statement object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the Statement object is closed, it throws an SQLException with a message indicating that the Statement is closed.

If the Statement object is not closed, the method attempts to retrieve the default fetch size using the `getFetchSize()` method. If a SQLException is thrown during this process, the method catches the exception and throws a new SQLException with a message indicating that a database access error occurred, along with the original exception message.

This updated method provides better error handling and helps to ensure that the application can handle unexpected errors gracefully.
