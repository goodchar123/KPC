Please write a java method that Retrieves the number of result set rows that is the default fetch size for ResultSet objects generated from this Statement object.
Here's the Java method that retrieves the default fetch size for ResultSet objects generated from a Statement object:

```java
public int getDefaultFetchSize(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    return stmt.getFetchSize();
}
```

This method takes a Statement object as a parameter and returns an integer value representing the default fetch size for ResultSet objects generated from that Statement object. The method uses the `getFetchSize()` method of the Statement object to retrieve the default fetch size. If an SQLException is thrown during the execution of this method, it will be propagated to the calling method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.getFetchSize() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a database access error or a closed Statement object before retrieving the default fetch size for ResultSet objects:

```java
public int getDefaultFetchSize(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    if (stmt.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed.");
    }
    try {
        return stmt.getFetchSize();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the Statement object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the Statement object is closed, it throws an SQLException with a message indicating that the Statement is closed.

If the Statement object is not closed, the method attempts to retrieve the default fetch size using the `getFetchSize()` method. If a SQLException is thrown during this process, the method catches the exception and throws a new SQLException with a message indicating that a database access error occurred, along with the original exception message.

This updated method provides better error handling and helps to ensure that the application can handle unexpected errors gracefully.
