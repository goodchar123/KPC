Sure, here's an updated version of the `storeKeystore` method that includes the requested error checking:

```java
public void storeKeystore(OutputStream outputStream, char[] password, KeyStore keyStore) throws KeyStoreException, IOException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, CertificateException {
    if (keyStore == null) {
        throw new KeyStoreException("Keystore has not been initialized (loaded)");
    }
    try {
        keyStore.store(outputStream, password);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("I/O problem with data", e);
    } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        throw new NoSuchAlgorithmException("Appropriate data integrity algorithm could not be found", e);
    } catch (CertificateException e) {
        throw new CertificateException("Certificates could not be stored", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `KeyStore` object is null, indicating that it has not been initialized or loaded. If it is null, a `KeyStoreException` is thrown with an appropriate error message.

Next, the method attempts to store the keystore using the `store` method on the `KeyStore` object. If an `IOException` is thrown, it is caught and re-thrown with a more specific error message. Similarly, if a `NoSuchAlgorithmException` or `CertificateException` is thrown, they are caught and re-thrown with more specific error messages.

These error checks should help to provide more informative error messages in case something goes wrong during the keystore storage process.
