Please write a java method that Insert a new empty row in the table.
Sure, here's an example Java method that inserts a new empty row into a table:

```java
public void insertEmptyRow(Connection conn, String tableName) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "INSERT INTO " + tableName + " DEFAULT VALUES";
    try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        stmt.executeUpdate();
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Connection` object and the name of the table as parameters. It then creates a SQL statement that inserts a new row with default values into the table. The `PreparedStatement` is used to execute the SQL statement and insert the new row into the table. If an exception occurs during the execution of the SQL statement, it is thrown as a `SQLException`.

Please check when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the setQueryTimeout method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running Statement for java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLTimeoutException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `insertEmptyRow` method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the statement if the timeout has been exceeded:

```java
public void insertEmptyRow(Connection conn, String tableName, int timeoutSeconds) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "INSERT INTO " + tableName + " DEFAULT VALUES";
    try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        stmt.setQueryTimeout(timeoutSeconds);
        stmt.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        // Attempt to cancel the statement if the timeout has been exceeded
        stmt.cancel();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `timeoutSeconds` which specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for the statement to execute before timing out. The `setQueryTimeout` method is called on the `PreparedStatement` to set the query timeout to the specified value.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown during the execution of the statement, the `catch` block attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel` method and then re-throws the exception. This ensures that the statement is properly cleaned up and any resources are released.

Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.

Sure, here's an updated version of the `insertEmptyRow` method that checks for database access errors and closed connections, as well as query timeouts:

```java
public void insertEmptyRow(Connection conn, String tableName, int timeoutSeconds) throws SQLException {
    if (conn == null || conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is null or closed");
    }
    String sql = "INSERT INTO " + tableName + " DEFAULT VALUES";
    try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        stmt.setQueryTimeout(timeoutSeconds);
        stmt.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        // Attempt to cancel the statement if the timeout has been exceeded
        stmt.cancel();
        throw e;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Check for database access errors or closed connections
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0 || e.getSQLState().equals("08003")) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error or closed connection", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `Connection` object is null or closed, and throws a `SQLException` if either condition is true.

Next, the SQL statement is prepared and the query timeout is set using the `setQueryTimeout` method. If a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown during the execution of the statement, the `catch` block attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel` method and then re-throws the exception.

Finally, the `catch` block also checks for other types of `SQLExceptions`, specifically those with an error code of 0 or a SQL state of "08003". These indicate database access errors or closed connections, and a new `SQLException` is thrown with a more descriptive error message. If the exception is not one of these types, it is re-thrown as-is.
