Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested exception handling:

```
public boolean isAcceptable(SelectionKey key) throws IOException {
    if (key.isAcceptable()) {
        ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = (ServerSocketChannel) key.channel();
        if (key.isCancelled()) {
            throw new CancelledKeyException();
        }
        try {
            SocketChannel socketChannel = serverSocketChannel.accept();
            if (socketChannel != null) {
                // Connection accepted
                return true;
            }
        } catch (ClosedChannelException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (AsynchronousCloseException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (ClosedByInterruptException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (NotYetBoundException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle other exceptions
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This updated method includes exception handling for the following scenarios:

- If the key has been cancelled, a `CancelledKeyException` is thrown.
- If the channel is closed, a `ClosedChannelException` is thrown.
- If another thread closes the channel while the accept operation is in progress, an `AsynchronousCloseException` is thrown.
- If another thread interrupts the current thread while the accept operation is in progress, a `ClosedByInterruptException` is thrown.
- If the channel's socket has not yet been bound, a `NotYetBoundException` is thrown.
- If a security manager denies access to the remote endpoint of the new connection, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

Note that the `IOException` thrown by the `accept()` method is caught and handled separately, as it may indicate other types of exceptions not covered by the specific scenarios listed above.
