
Sure, here's an updated version of the `createAlphaComposite` method that checks if the specified rule is valid and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is not:

```
public AlphaComposite createAlphaComposite(int rule) {
    if (rule != AlphaComposite.CLEAR &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.SRC &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.DST &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.DST_OVER &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.SRC_IN &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.DST_IN &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.SRC_OUT &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.DST_OUT &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.SRC_ATOP &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.DST_ATOP &&
        rule != AlphaComposite.XOR) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid blending rule specified.");
    }
    return AlphaComposite.getInstance(rule);
}
```

This updated method first checks if the specified rule is one of the valid blending rules. If it is not, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that an invalid blending rule was specified. If the rule is valid, the method returns an AlphaComposite object that uses the specified rule.

Here's an example of how you could use this updated method:

```
AlphaComposite ac = createAlphaComposite(AlphaComposite.CLEAR); // This will throw an IllegalArgumentException
``` 

In this example, the `createAlphaComposite` method is called with the `CLEAR` blending rule, which is not a valid rule. This will cause the method to throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
