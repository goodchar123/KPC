Please write a java method that Obtains an instance of LocalTime from an hour, minute and second.
Sure, here's an example Java method that obtains an instance of LocalTime from an hour, minute, and second:

```java
import java.time.LocalTime;

public class TimeHelper {
    public static LocalTime getTime(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        return LocalTime.of(hour, minute, second);
    }
}
```

You can call this method by passing in the hour, minute, and second as arguments:

```java
LocalTime time = TimeHelper.getTime(10, 30, 0);
System.out.println(time); // Output: 10:30:00
``` 

This will create a LocalTime object with the specified hour, minute, and second.

Please check if the value of any field is out of range for java.time.LocalTime.of(int,int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
You're right, it's important to validate the input values to ensure they are within the valid range for `LocalTime`. Here's an updated version of the `getTime` method that includes input validation:

```java
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.time.DateTimeException;

public class TimeHelper {
    public static LocalTime getTime(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        try {
            return LocalTime.of(hour, minute, second);
        } catch (DateTimeException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid input values for LocalTime: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown if the input values are out of range. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown as a new `DateTimeException` with a more descriptive error message.

You can call this method in the same way as before, and it will throw an exception if any of the input values are out of range:

```java
LocalTime time = TimeHelper.getTime(25, 30, 0); // Throws DateTimeException
``` 

I hope this helps!
