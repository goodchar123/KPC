You're right, it's important to validate the input values to ensure they are within the valid range for `LocalTime`. Here's an updated version of the `getTime` method that includes input validation:

```java
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.time.DateTimeException;

public class TimeHelper {
    public static LocalTime getTime(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        try {
            return LocalTime.of(hour, minute, second);
        } catch (DateTimeException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid input values for LocalTime: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown if the input values are out of range. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown as a new `DateTimeException` with a more descriptive error message.

You can call this method in the same way as before, and it will throw an exception if any of the input values are out of range:

```java
LocalTime time = TimeHelper.getTime(25, 30, 0); // Throws DateTimeException
``` 

I hope this helps!
