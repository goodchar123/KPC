Please write a java method that Returns the result value when complete, or throws an (unchecked) exception if completed exceptionally.
Here is an example of a Java method that returns the result value when complete or throws an unchecked exception if completed exceptionally:

```java
public static <T> T getResultValue(CompletableFuture<T> future) {
    try {
        return future.get();
    } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Error occurred while getting result value", e);
    }
}
```

This method takes a `CompletableFuture` as input and returns the result value when the future is completed successfully. If the future is completed exceptionally, it throws a `RuntimeException` with the original exception as the cause.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this future was cancelled for java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture.get() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw CancellationException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the future was cancelled before returning the result value, and throws a `CancellationException` if it was cancelled:

```java
public static <T> T getResultValue(CompletableFuture<T> future) throws CancellationException {
    try {
        T result = future.get();
        if (future.isCancelled()) {
            throw new CancellationException();
        }
        return result;
    } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Error occurred while getting result value", e);
    }
}
```

This method first gets the result value from the future using `future.get()`, and then checks if the future was cancelled using `future.isCancelled()`. If the future was cancelled, it throws a `CancellationException`. Otherwise, it returns the result value.

Note that we added the `throws CancellationException` to the method signature to indicate that this exception may be thrown by the method.
