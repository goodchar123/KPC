Please write a java method that Writes a sequence of chars to the stream at the current position.
Here's an example Java method that writes a sequence of chars to the stream at the current position:

```java
public void writeCharsToFile(String fileName, String data) throws IOException {
    FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(fileName);
    writer.write(data);
    writer.close();
}
```

This method takes in two parameters: the file name and the data to be written. It uses a `FileWriter` object to write the data to the file. The `write()` method of the `FileWriter` object writes the data to the file at the current position. Finally, the `close()` method is called to close the file and release any resources associated with it. 

Note that this method throws an `IOException` if there is an error while writing to the file. You can handle this exception in the calling code by using a try-catch block.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.Writer.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for an I/O error when closing the `Writer` and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
public void writeCharsToFile(String fileName, String data) throws IOException {
    FileWriter writer = null;
    try {
        writer = new FileWriter(fileName);
        writer.write(data);
    } finally {
        if (writer != null) {
            try {
                writer.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error closing writer: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we use a try-finally block to ensure that the `Writer` is closed even if an exception is thrown while writing to the file. The `finally` block checks if the `Writer` is not null and attempts to close it. If an `IOException` occurs while closing the `Writer`, we throw a new `IOException` with a message indicating the error.

This way, if an I/O error occurs while closing the `Writer`, the method will throw an `IOException` with a descriptive error message.
