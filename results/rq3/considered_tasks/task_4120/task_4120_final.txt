Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for errors when calling `setPrefix()` and throws an `XMLStreamException` if an error occurs:

```java
public void beginNamespaceMapping(String prefix, String uri) throws XMLStreamException {
    // Get the current XML writer
    XMLStreamWriter writer = getXMLStreamWriter();
    
    // Check if Namespace writing is allowed
    if (writer.getNamespaceContext() == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Namespace writing not allowed in current state");
    }
    
    // Begin the scope of the Namespace mapping
    try {
        writer.setPrefix(prefix, uri);
    } catch (XMLStreamException e) {
        throw new XMLStreamException("Error setting Namespace prefix", e);
    }
    writer.writeNamespace(prefix, uri);
}
```

This updated method first checks if the current XML writer's Namespace context is not null, which indicates that Namespace writing is allowed in the current state. If the Namespace context is null, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown with a message indicating that Namespace writing is not allowed in the current state.

If Namespace writing is allowed, the method proceeds to set the prefix-URI mapping using `setPrefix()`. If an `XMLStreamException` is thrown, it's caught and re-thrown as an `XMLStreamException` with a more informative message.

Finally, the method calls `writeNamespace()` to write the Namespace declaration to the output, as in the previous versions of the method.

If an `XMLStreamException` is thrown at any point, it's propagated up to the caller.
