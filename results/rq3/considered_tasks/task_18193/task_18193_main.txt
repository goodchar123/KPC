Please write a java method that Returns the current system properties in the target virtual machine.
Here's a Java method that returns the current system properties in the target virtual machine:

```java
public static Properties getSystemProperties() {
    return System.getProperties();
}
```

This method simply calls the `getProperties()` method of the `System` class, which returns a `Properties` object containing the current system properties. You can then use this `Properties` object to access and manipulate the system properties as needed.

Please check if a security manager exists and its             checkPropertiesAccess method doesn't allow access             to the system properties. for java.lang.System.getProperties() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if a security manager exists and its `checkPropertiesAccess` method doesn't allow access to the system properties before returning them. If the security manager exists and doesn't allow access, a `SecurityException` is thrown:

```java
public static Properties getSystemProperties() {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        try {
            sm.checkPropertiesAccess();
        } catch (SecurityException se) {
            throw new SecurityException("Access to system properties is not allowed", se);
        }
    }
    return System.getProperties();
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager exists by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager exists, it calls its `checkPropertiesAccess()` method to check if access to the system properties is allowed. If the security manager doesn't allow access, a `SecurityException` is thrown with a message indicating that access to system properties is not allowed. If the security manager allows access, the method returns the system properties as a `Properties` object.
