Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if a security manager exists and its `checkPropertiesAccess` method doesn't allow access to the system properties before returning them. If the security manager exists and doesn't allow access, a `SecurityException` is thrown:

```java
public static Properties getSystemProperties() {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurity
