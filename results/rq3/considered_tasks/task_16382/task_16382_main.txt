Please write a java method that Implements absolute timed condition wait.
Here's an example Java method that implements absolute timed condition wait using the `Condition` interface from the `java.util.concurrent` package:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class AbsoluteTimedConditionWaitExample {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private final Condition condition = lock.newCondition();

    public void absoluteTimedConditionWait(long timeoutMillis) throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            long deadline = System.currentTimeMillis() + timeoutMillis;
            while (!condition.awaitUntil(new java.util.Date(deadline))) {
                if (System.currentTimeMillis() >= deadline) {
                    // Timeout has occurred
                    break;
                }
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `absoluteTimedConditionWait` method takes a `timeoutMillis` parameter that specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for the condition to be signaled. The method first acquires a lock using a `ReentrantLock` instance, and then calculates a deadline for the wait operation using the current time and the timeout value.

The method then enters a loop that repeatedly calls the `awaitUntil` method on the `Condition` instance until either the condition is signaled or the deadline is reached. If the deadline is reached before the condition is signaled, the method breaks out of the loop and returns.

Note that the `awaitUntil` method returns a `boolean` value indicating whether the condition was signaled or the deadline was reached. If the method returns `false`, the loop continues to wait for the condition to be signaled. If the method returns `true`, the loop exits and the method returns.

Please check if the current thread does not         hold this lock for java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock.unlock() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
You are correct, it is important to check if the current thread holds the lock before calling `unlock()` on a `ReentrantLock` instance. If the current thread does not hold the lock, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` should be thrown.

Here's an updated version of the `absoluteTimedConditionWait` method that includes this check:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class AbsoluteTimedConditionWaitExample {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private final Condition condition = lock.newCondition();

    public void absoluteTimedConditionWait(long timeoutMillis) throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            long deadline = System.currentTimeMillis() + timeoutMillis;
            while (!condition.awaitUntil(new java.util.Date(deadline))) {
                if (System.currentTimeMillis() >= deadline) {
                    // Timeout has occurred
                    break;
                }
            }
        } finally {
            if (lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) {
                lock.unlock();
            } else {
                throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Current thread does not hold the lock");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, the `finally` block checks if the current thread holds the lock using the `isHeldByCurrentThread()` method. If the current thread holds the lock, the `unlock()` method is called to release the lock. If the current thread does not hold the lock, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is thrown.
