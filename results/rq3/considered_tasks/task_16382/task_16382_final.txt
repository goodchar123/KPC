You are correct, it is important to check if the current thread holds the lock before calling `unlock()` on a `ReentrantLock` instance. If the current thread does not hold the lock, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` should be thrown.

Here's an updated version of the `absoluteTimedConditionWait` method that includes this check:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class AbsoluteTimedConditionWaitExample {
    private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private final Condition condition = lock.newCondition();

    public void absoluteTimedConditionWait(long timeoutMillis) throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            long deadline = System.currentTimeMillis() + timeoutMillis;
            while (!condition.awaitUntil(new java.util.Date(deadline))) {
                if (System.currentTimeMillis() >= deadline) {
                    // Timeout has occurred
                    break;
                }
            }
        } finally {
            if (lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) {
                lock.unlock();
            } else {
                throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Current thread does not hold the lock");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, the `finally` block checks if the current thread holds the lock using the `isHeldByCurrentThread()` method. If the current thread holds the lock, the `unlock()` method is called to release the lock. If the current thread does not hold the lock, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is thrown.
