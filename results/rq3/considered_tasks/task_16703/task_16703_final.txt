Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the `TrustManagerFactory.init()` operation fails and throws a `KeyStoreException` if it does:

```
public void initializeTrustMaterial(TrustManagerFactory factory, KeyStore trustStore) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, KeyStoreException {
    try {
        factory.init(trustStore);
    } catch (KeyStoreException | NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
        throw new KeyStoreException("Failed to initialize TrustManagerFactory with trust material", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch any `KeyStoreException` or `NoSuchAlgorithmException` that may be thrown by the `TrustManagerFactory.init()` method. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `KeyStoreException` with a message indicating that the initialization failed.

This should help you handle any errors that may occur during the initialization process.
