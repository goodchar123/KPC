Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state before calling the `build` method. If the builder has already been built, it throws an `IllegalStateException`:

```
public Stream<String> buildStream(List<String> list) {
    Stream.Builder<String> builder = Stream.builder();
    for (String s : list) {
        builder.add(s);
    }
    try {
        return builder.build();
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Builder has already been built");
    }
}
```

This method tries to build the stream using the `build` method and catches any `IllegalStateException` that may be thrown if the builder has already been built. If an exception is caught, it throws a new `IllegalStateException` with a custom message. Otherwise, the method returns the built stream.
