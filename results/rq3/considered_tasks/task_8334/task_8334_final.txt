Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the necessary exception handling:

```
public void addSubscriber(String subscriber, List<String> subscribers) {
    try {
        if (!subscribers.contains(subscriber)) {
            subscribers.add(subscriber);
            System.out.println(subscriber + " has been added as a subscriber.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(subscriber + " is already subscribed.");
        }
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        System.out.println("The specified element is incompatible with this list.");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        System.out.println("The specified element is null and this list does not permit null elements.");
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        System.out.println("The add operation is not supported by this list.");
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        System.out.println("Some property of this element prevents it from being added to this list.");
    }
}
```

This method now includes a try-catch block that handles the potential exceptions that could be thrown by the `contains()` and `add()` methods. 

If the specified element is incompatible with the list or if the add operation is not supported, it will catch the `ClassCastException` or `UnsupportedOperationException` respectively and print an appropriate error message. 

If the specified element is null and the list does not permit null elements, it will catch the `NullPointerException` and print an appropriate error message. 

If the class of the specified element prevents it from being added to the list or if some property of the element prevents it from being added, it will catch the `ClassCastException` or `IllegalArgumentException` respectively and print an appropriate error message.
