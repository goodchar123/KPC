I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes all the requested checks:

```java
public static <T> void removeLastReturned(ListIterator<T> iterator) {
    if (!iterator.hasNext() && !iterator.hasPrevious()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("Iterator has no next or previous element");
    }
    if (iterator.hasNext()) {
        T nextElement = iterator.next();
        iterator.remove();
        if (!iterator.hasPrevious()) {
            return;
        }
        iterator.previous();
        iterator.add(nextElement);
        iterator.next();
    } else {
        iterator.previous();
        iterator.remove();
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the iterator has no next or previous element and throws a `NoSuchElementException` with a message if that's the case. It then checks if there is a next element and removes it. If there is no previous element, it simply returns. If there is a previous element, it moves the iterator back to it, adds the removed element back to the list, moves the iterator forward to the next element, and returns. If there is no next element, it moves the iterator back to the previous element and removes it.

Note that this method assumes that the list iterator supports the `remove()`, `add()`, and `hasPrevious()` operations. If it doesn't, it will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` when any of these methods are called.
