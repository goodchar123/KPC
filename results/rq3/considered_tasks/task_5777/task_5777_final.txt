Here's the updated Java method that checks for errors in the underlying protocol for both `setBroadcast()` and `getBroadcast()` methods and throws a `SocketException` if necessary:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class BroadcastTest {
    public static boolean isBroadcastEnabled() throws SocketException {
        DatagramSocket socket = new DatagramSocket();
        try {
            socket.setBroadcast(true);
            boolean isEnabled = socket.getBroadcast();
            if (!isEnabled) {
                throw new SocketException("Error in underlying protocol, such as a UDP error");
            }
            return isEnabled;
        } catch (SocketException e) {
            throw e;
        } finally {
            socket.close();
        }
    }
}
```

This method is similar to the previous one, but it now catches the `SocketException` thrown by `setBroadcast()` and re-throws it. This ensures that any errors in the underlying protocol are properly propagated.
