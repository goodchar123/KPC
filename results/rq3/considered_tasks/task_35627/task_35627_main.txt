Please write a java method that Sets the current KeyboardFocusManager instance for the calling thread's context.
Here's a Java method that sets the current KeyboardFocusManager instance for the calling thread's context:

```
public void setKeyboardFocusManager(KeyboardFocusManager manager) {
    KeyboardFocusManager.setCurrentKeyboardFocusManager(manager);
}
```

This method takes a `KeyboardFocusManager` instance as a parameter and sets it as the current keyboard focus manager for the calling thread's context using the `setCurrentKeyboardFocusManager` method of the `KeyboardFocusManager` class.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the calling thread does not have permission         to replace the current KeyboardFocusManager for java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager.setCurrentKeyboardFocusManager(java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the calling thread has permission to replace the current KeyboardFocusManager. If the calling thread does not have permission, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```
public void setKeyboardFocusManager(KeyboardFocusManager manager) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkPermission(new AWTPermission("replaceKeyboardFocusManager"));
    }
    KeyboardFocusManager.setCurrentKeyboardFocusManager(manager);
}
```

This method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a `SecurityManager` is installed, it checks if the calling thread has permission to replace the current KeyboardFocusManager using the `checkPermission` method of the `SecurityManager` class. If the calling thread does not have permission, it throws a `SecurityException`. Finally, it sets the current KeyboardFocusManager using the `setCurrentKeyboardFocusManager` method of the `KeyboardFocusManager` class.
