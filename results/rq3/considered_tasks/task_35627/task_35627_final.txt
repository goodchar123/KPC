
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the calling thread has permission to replace the current KeyboardFocusManager. If the calling thread does not have permission, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```
public void setKeyboardFocusManager(KeyboardFocusManager manager) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkPermission(new AWTPermission("replaceKeyboardFocusManager"));
    }
    KeyboardFocusManager.setCurrentKeyboardFocusManager(manager);
}
```

This method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a `SecurityManager` is installed, it checks if the calling thread has permission to replace the current KeyboardFocusManager using the `checkPermission` method of the `SecurityManager` class. If the calling thread does not have permission, it throws a `SecurityException`. Finally, it sets the current KeyboardFocusManager using the `setCurrentKeyboardFocusManager` method of the `KeyboardFocusManager` class.
