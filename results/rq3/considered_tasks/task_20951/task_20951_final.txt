
Here's the updated Java method that includes error handling for the `getTypeInfo()`, `next()`, and `getString()` methods:

```java
public boolean supportsAlterTableWithAddColumn(DatabaseMetaData metadata) throws SQLException {
    boolean supportsAlterTable = false;
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        rs = metadata.getTypeInfo();
        while (rs.next()) {
            String typeName = rs.getString("TYPE_NAME");
            if (typeName.equalsIgnoreCase("ALTER TABLE")) {
                supportsAlterTable = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error accessing database metadata: " + e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        if (rs != null) {
            try {
                rs.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw new SQLException("Error closing result set: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
    return supportsAlterTable;
}
```

In this updated method, we've added a try-catch block around the `getTypeInfo()` method call to catch any `SQLException` that may occur. If an exception is caught, we throw a new `SQLException` with a custom error message that includes the original exception's message.

We've also added a finally block to ensure that the `ResultSet` is closed properly, even if an exception is thrown. Within the finally block, we check if the `ResultSet` is not null before calling the `close()` method. If an exception occurs while closing the `ResultSet`, we throw a new `SQLException` with a custom error message.

Finally, we've added a try-catch block around the `next()` and `getString()` method calls within the while loop to catch any `SQLException` that may occur. If an exception is caught, we throw a new `SQLException` with a custom error message that includes the original exception's message.
