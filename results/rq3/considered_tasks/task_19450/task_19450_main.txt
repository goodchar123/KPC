Please write a java method that Returns the channel number of this CardChannel.
Here's a Java method that returns the channel number of a CardChannel:

```java
public int getChannelNumber(CardChannel channel) {
    try {
        return channel.getChannelNumber();
    } catch (CardException e) {
        // Handle exception
        return -1;
    }
}
```

This method takes a `CardChannel` object as input and returns an integer representing the channel number of the card channel. It uses the `getChannelNumber()` method of the `CardChannel` class to retrieve the channel number. If an exception is thrown, it returns -1.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this channel has been   closed or if the corresponding Card has been   disconnected. for javax.smartcardio.CardChannel.getChannelNumber() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the channel has been closed or if the corresponding card has been disconnected before returning the channel number. If either of these conditions is true, it throws an `IllegalStateException`:

```java
public int getChannelNumber(CardChannel channel) {
    try {
        if (!channel.getCard().isValid() || !channel.isOpen()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Channel has been closed or card has been disconnected");
        }
        return channel.getChannelNumber();
    } catch (CardException e) {
        // Handle exception
        return -1;
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the card associated with the channel is still valid and if the channel is still open. If either of these conditions is false, it throws an `IllegalStateException` with an appropriate message. Otherwise, it returns the channel number using the `getChannelNumber()` method of the `CardChannel` class. If an exception is thrown, it returns -1.
