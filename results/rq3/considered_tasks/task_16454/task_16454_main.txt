Please write a java method that Moves all threads from the wait queue for this condition to the wait queue for the owning lock.
Here's an example Java method that moves all threads from the wait queue for a given condition to the wait queue for the owning lock:

```java
public void moveThreadsToLockWaitQueue(Condition condition, Lock lock) {
    // Get the lock's monitor
    Object monitor = ((ReentrantLock) lock).getLock();

    // Synchronize on the monitor to ensure thread safety
    synchronized (monitor) {
        // Get the wait queue for the condition
        WaitQueue waitQueue = ((AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject) condition).getWaitQueue();

        // Move all threads from the condition's wait queue to the lock's wait queue
        while (waitQueue.hasNodes()) {
            Node node = waitQueue.remove();
            ((AbstractQueuedSynchronizer) lock).addWaiter(node);
        }
    }
}
```

This method first gets the lock's monitor object by casting the lock to a `ReentrantLock` and calling its `getLock()` method. It then synchronizes on the monitor to ensure thread safety.

Next, it gets the wait queue for the given condition by casting the condition to an `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject` and calling its `getWaitQueue()` method.

Finally, it loops through the condition's wait queue, removing each node and adding it to the lock's wait queue using the lock's `addWaiter()` method. This effectively moves all threads from the condition's wait queue to the lock's wait queue.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread is not         the owner of the object's monitor for java.lang.Object.wait() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
Please check if any thread interrupted the current thread before or         while the current thread was waiting. The interrupted status of the         current thread is cleared when this exception is thrown. for java.lang.Object.wait() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InterruptedException.
Please check if the current thread is not               the owner of this object's monitor. for java.lang.Object.notifyAll() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the checks you requested:

```java
public void moveThreadsToLockWaitQueue(Condition condition, Lock lock) throws InterruptedException {
    // Get the lock's monitor
    Object monitor = ((ReentrantLock) lock).getLock();

    // Synchronize on the monitor to ensure thread safety
    synchronized (monitor) {
        // Check if the current thread is the owner of the monitor
        if (Thread.currentThread() != ((AbstractQueuedSynchronizer) lock).getExclusiveOwnerThread()) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
        }

        // Check if the current thread was interrupted while waiting
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException();
        }

        // Get the wait queue for the condition
        WaitQueue waitQueue = ((AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject) condition).getWaitQueue();

        // Move all threads from the condition's wait queue to the lock's wait queue
        while (waitQueue.hasNodes()) {
            Node node = waitQueue.remove();
            ((AbstractQueuedSynchronizer) lock).addWaiter(node);
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the current thread is the owner of the lock's monitor. If not, it throws an `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

Next, it checks if the current thread was interrupted while waiting. If so, it throws an `InterruptedException`. Note that the interrupted status of the current thread is cleared when this exception is thrown.

Finally, it proceeds with moving the threads from the condition's wait queue to the lock's wait queue as before.
