Please write a java method that Relative get method for reading an int value.
Here's an example of a Java method that uses the Relative get method for reading an int value:

```
public int readInt(DataInputStream input) throws IOException {
    return input.readInt();
}
```

This method takes a `DataInputStream` object as input and uses its `readInt()` method to read an int value from the input stream. The `readInt()` method is a Relative get method because it reads the next four bytes of the input stream and interprets them as an int value. If there are not enough bytes remaining in the input stream to read an int value, an `IOException` is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this input stream reaches the end before               reading four bytes. for java.io.DataInputStream.readInt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw EOFException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the input stream reaches the end before reading four bytes:

```
public int readInt(DataInputStream input) throws IOException {
    if (input.available() < 4) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return input.readInt();
}
```

This method first checks if the number of bytes available in the input stream is less than four using the `available()` method. If there are less than four bytes available, it means that the input stream has reached the end and an `EOFException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method uses the `readInt()` method to read an int value from the input stream.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check the stream has been closed and the contained             input stream does not support reading after close, or             another I/O error occurs. for java.io.DataInputStream.readInt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Certainly, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the stream has been closed or if the contained input stream does not support reading after close:

```
public int readInt(DataInputStream input) throws IOException {
    if (input == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("input is null");
    }
    if (input.markSupported()) {
        input.mark(4);
    }
    try {
        return input.readInt();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        if (e.getMessage().equals("Stream closed")) {
            throw new IOException("Stream closed");
        } else if (e.getMessage().equals("read beyond end of stream")) {
            throw new EOFException("read beyond end of stream");
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    } finally {
        if (input.markSupported()) {
            input.reset();
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the input stream is null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. It then checks if the input stream supports marking and marks the current position in the input stream if it does. This is done so that the method can reset the input stream to its original position in case an exception is thrown.

The method then tries to read an int value from the input stream using the `readInt()` method. If an `IOException` is thrown, the method checks the error message to see if it indicates that the stream has been closed or if the contained input stream does not support reading after close. If either of these conditions is true, the method throws an `IOException`. Otherwise, it rethrows the original exception.

Finally, the method resets the input stream to its original position if it supports marking.
