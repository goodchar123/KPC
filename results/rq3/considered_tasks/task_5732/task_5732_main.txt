Please write a java method that Connects this socket to the specified port number on the specified host.
Sure, here's an example Java method that connects a socket to a specified port number on a specified host:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class SocketConnector {
    public static void connectSocket(String host, int port) {
        try {
            // Create a new socket with the specified host and port
            Socket socket = new Socket(host, port);
            
            // Do something with the socket, such as sending or receiving data
            
            // Close the socket when finished
            socket.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

To use this method, simply call `SocketConnector.connectSocket("example.com", 80)` with the desired host and port values. Note that this method will throw an exception if the connection fails, so you may want to handle that case appropriately in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when closing this socket. for java.net.Socket.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `connectSocket` method that checks for an I/O error when closing the socket:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketConnector {
    public static void connectSocket(String host, int port) throws IOException {
        Socket socket = null;
        try {
            // Create a new socket with the specified host and port
            socket = new Socket(host, port);

            // Do something with the socket, such as sending or receiving data
        } finally {
            // Close the socket and check for I/O errors
            if (socket != null) {
                try {
                    socket.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new IOException("Error closing socket", e);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this version of the method, we use a `try-finally` block to ensure that the socket is always closed, even if an exception is thrown while using it. We also check for an `IOException` when closing the socket, and if one occurs, we throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. This way, any errors that occur during the socket connection process are properly handled and reported.
