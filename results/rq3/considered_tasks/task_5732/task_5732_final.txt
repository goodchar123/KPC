Sure, here's an updated version of the `connectSocket` method that checks for an I/O error when closing the socket:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketConnector {
    public static void connectSocket(String host, int port) throws IOException {
        Socket socket = null;
        try {
            // Create a new socket with the specified host and port
            socket = new Socket(host, port);

            // Do something with the socket, such as sending or receiving data
        } finally {
            // Close the socket and check for I/O errors
            if (socket != null) {
                try {
                    socket.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new IOException("Error closing socket", e);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this version of the method, we use a `try-finally` block to ensure that the socket is always closed, even if an exception is thrown while using it. We also check for an `IOException` when closing the socket, and if one occurs, we throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. This way, any errors that occur during the socket connection process are properly handled and reported.
