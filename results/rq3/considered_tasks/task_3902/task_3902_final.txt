Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for any SAX exception, possibly wrapping another exception, when receiving notification of ignorable whitespace in element content using the SAX parser:

```java
import org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler;
import org.xml.sax.SAXException;
import org.xml.sax.Attributes;

public class MyHandler extends DefaultHandler {
    
    public void ignorableWhitespace(char[] ch, int start, int length) throws SAXException {
        try {
            String whitespace = new String(ch, start, length);
            System.out.println("Ignorable whitespace: " + whitespace);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new SAXException("Error handling ignorable whitespace", e);
        }
    }
    
    // other methods for handling XML events
}
```

In this updated version, the `ignorableWhitespace` method is still overridden from the `DefaultHandler` class to receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content. However, it now includes a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur when handling the whitespace. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `SAXException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while handling the whitespace, and the original exception as the cause.

This updated version ensures that any exceptions that occur during the handling of ignorable whitespace are properly handled and propagated up the call stack.
