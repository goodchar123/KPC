Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks for an I/O error when detaching from the virtual machine and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
import com.sun.tools.attach.VirtualMachine;

public static void attachToVM(String pid) throws Exception {
    VirtualMachine vm = VirtualMachine.attach(pid);
    try {
        // Do something with the attached VM
    } finally {
        try {
            vm.detach();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // An I/O error occurred while detaching from the VM
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, the `detach()` method is called within a `finally` block to ensure that it is always called, even if an exception is thrown while working with the attached VM. If an `IOException` is thrown while detaching, it is caught and re-thrown as an `IOException` from the `attachToVM()` method.
