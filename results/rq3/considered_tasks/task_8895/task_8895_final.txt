Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the deque before inserting an element at the end. If the current thread is not allowed to modify the deque, a `SecurityException` is thrown instead of inserting the element.

```java
public void insertAtEnd(Deque deque, Object element) throws InterruptedException, SecurityException {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
    }
    deque.putLast(element);
}
```

This method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed in the JVM. If there is a `SecurityManager`, it checks if the current thread has the `modifyThread` permission before inserting the element at the end of the deque. If the current thread does not have the permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

Note that the `modifyThread` permission is a custom permission that needs to be defined and granted to the threads that are allowed to modify the deque.
