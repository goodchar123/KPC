Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the necessary checks and exceptions:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.channels.FileLock;
import java.nio.channels.NonReadableChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.NonWritableChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.OverlappingFileLockException;
import java.nio.channels.FileLockInterruptionException;
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException;

public class FileLockExample {
    public static void lockRegion(FileChannel channel, long position, long size, boolean shared) throws IOException {
        if (position < 0 || size < 0 || position + size > channel.size()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        if (!channel.isOpen()) {
            throw new ClosedChannelException();
        }
        FileLock lock = null;
        try {
            lock = channel.lock(position, size, shared);
        } catch (AsynchronousCloseException e) {
            throw new AsynchronousCloseException();
        } catch (FileLockInterruptionException e) {
            throw new FileLockInterruptionException();
        } catch (NonReadableChannelException e) {
            if (shared) {
                throw new NonReadableChannelException();
            }
        } catch (NonWritableChannelException e) {
            if (!shared) {
                throw new NonWritableChannelException();
            }
        } catch (OverlappingFileLockException e) {
            throw new OverlappingFileLockException();
        }
        if (lock == null) {
            throw new IOException();
        }
        // Do something with the lock...
        lock.release();
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following checks and exceptions:

- If the position or size parameters are negative, or if the requested lock region extends beyond the end of the file, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- If the channel is closed, a `ClosedChannelException` is thrown.
- If another thread closes the channel while the invoking thread is blocked in this method, an `AsynchronousCloseException` is thrown.
- If the invoking thread is interrupted while blocked in this method, a `FileLockInterruptionException` is thrown.
- If a lock that overlaps the requested region is already held by this Java virtual machine, or if another thread is already blocked in this method and is attempting to lock an overlapping region, an `OverlappingFileLockException` is thrown.
- If `shared` is true but the channel was not opened for reading, a `NonReadableChannelException` is thrown.
- If `shared` is false but the channel was not opened for writing, a `NonWritableChannelException` is thrown.
- If the channel used to acquire the lock is no longer open when `release()` is called, a `ClosedChannelException` is thrown.
