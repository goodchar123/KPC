Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public void addBoundAddress(SocketChannel channel, InetAddress address) throws IOException, SecurityException, IllegalArgumentException {
    ServerSocket socket = channel.socket();
    try {
        socket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(address, socket.getLocalPort()));
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Failed to bind socket to address: " + address, e);
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Security manager does not allow binding to address: " + address, e);
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid address or unsupported SocketAddress subclass: " + address, e);
    }
}
```

This updated method now includes error checking for the three scenarios you mentioned:

1. If the `bind()` operation fails or the socket is already bound, an `IOException` will be thrown with a descriptive error message.
2. If a `SecurityManager` is present and its `checkListen()` method doesn't allow the operation, a `SecurityException` will be thrown with a descriptive error message.
3. If the endpoint is a `SocketAddress` subclass not supported by the socket, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown with a descriptive error message.

By including these error checks, the method provides more robust error handling and helps to ensure that any issues with the binding process are properly handled and reported.
