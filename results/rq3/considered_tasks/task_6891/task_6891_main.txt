Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this LocalDate with the day-of-year altered.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given LocalDate with the day-of-year altered:

```java
public static LocalDate withDayOfYear(LocalDate date, int dayOfYear) {
    return date.withDayOfYear(dayOfYear);
}
```

This method takes a LocalDate object and an integer value representing the desired day-of-year. It then returns a copy of the LocalDate object with the day-of-year altered to the specified value. The original LocalDate object is not modified.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the day of year value is invalid,  or if the day of year is invalid for the year for java.time.LocalDate.withDayOfYear(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the day of year value is invalid or if the day of year is invalid for the year for `java.time.LocalDate.withDayOfYear(int)` method, and throws a `DateTimeException` if either of these conditions are met:

```java
public static LocalDate withDayOfYear(LocalDate date, int dayOfYear) {
    try {
        return date.withDayOfYear(dayOfYear);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid day of year value or day of year is invalid for the year", e);
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown by the `withDayOfYear()` method. If such an exception is caught, it throws a new `DateTimeException` with a custom error message indicating that the day of year value is invalid or the day of year is invalid for the year. The original exception is passed as a parameter to the new exception to preserve the stack trace.
