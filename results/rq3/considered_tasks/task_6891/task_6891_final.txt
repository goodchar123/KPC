Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the day of year value is invalid or if the day of year is invalid for the year for `java.time.LocalDate.withDayOfYear(int)` method, and throws a `DateTimeException` if either of these conditions are met:

```java
public static LocalDate withDayOfYear(LocalDate date, int dayOfYear) {
    try {
        return date.withDayOfYear(dayOfYear);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid day of year value or day of year is invalid for the year", e);
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown by the `withDayOfYear()` method. If such an exception is caught, it throws a new `DateTimeException` with a custom error message indicating that the day of year value is invalid or the day of year is invalid for the year. The original exception is passed as a parameter to the new exception to preserve the stack trace.
