Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the day of week is invalid for `java.time.DayOfWeek.of(int)` and throws a `DateTimeException` if it is:

```java
import java.time.DateTimeException;
import java.time.DayOfWeek;

public class DayOfWeekHelper {
    public static DayOfWeek getDayOfWeekFromInt(int day) {
        try {
            return DayOfWeek.of(day);
        } catch (DateTimeException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid day of week: " + day, e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method now uses a try-catch block to catch the `DateTimeException` that can be thrown if the day of week is invalid. If this exception is caught, a new `DateTimeException` is thrown with a message indicating the invalid day of week.
