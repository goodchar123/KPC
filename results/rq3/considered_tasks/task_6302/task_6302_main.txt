Please write a java method that Obtains an instance of DayOfWeek from an int value.
Sure, here's a Java method that obtains an instance of DayOfWeek from an int value:

```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;

public class DayOfWeekHelper {
    public static DayOfWeek getDayOfWeekFromInt(int day) {
        return DayOfWeek.of(day);
    }
}
```

This method takes an integer value representing the day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.) and returns an instance of the DayOfWeek enum. The `of` method of the DayOfWeek enum is used to obtain the instance.

Please check if the day of week is invalid for java.time.DayOfWeek.of(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the day of week is invalid for `java.time.DayOfWeek.of(int)` and throws a `DateTimeException` if it is:

```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.format.DateTimeParseException;

public class DayOfWeekHelper {
    public static DayOfWeek getDayOfWeekFromInt(int day) {
        try {
            return DayOfWeek.of(day);
        } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid day of week: " + day, e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method now uses a try-catch block to catch the `DateTimeParseException` that is thrown if the day of week is invalid. If this exception is caught, a new `DateTimeException` is thrown with a message indicating the invalid day of week.

```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.format.DateTimeParseException;
import java.time.format.ResolverStyle;
import java.time.format.TextStyle;
import java.util.Locale;

public class DayOfWeekHelper {
    public static DayOfWeek getDayOfWeekFromInt(int day) {
        try {
            return DayOfWeek.of(day);
        } catch (DateTimeParseException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid day of week: " + day, e);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid day of week: " + day, e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method now uses a try-catch block to catch both the `DateTimeParseException` and `IllegalArgumentException` that can be thrown if the day of week is invalid. If either of these exceptions is caught, a new `DateTimeException` is thrown with a message indicating the invalid day of week. 

Additionally, to avoid any ambiguity in resolving the day of week, we can set the `ResolverStyle` to `STRICT` by default. We can also use the `TextStyle` to get the name of the day of week in a specific locale. Here's the updated method:

```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.format.DateTimeParseException;
import java.time.format.ResolverStyle;
import java.time.format.TextStyle;
import java.util.Locale;

public class DayOfWeekHelper {
    public static DayOfWeek getDayOfWeekFromInt(int day) {
        try {
            return DayOfWeek.of(day);
        } catch (DateTimeParseException | IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid day of week: " + day, e);
        }
    }
    
    public static String getDayOfWeekName(int day, Locale locale) {
        try {
            DayOfWeek dayOfWeek = DayOfWeek.of(day);
            return dayOfWeek.getDisplayName(TextStyle.FULL, locale);
        } catch (DateTimeParseException | IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid day of week: " + day, e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method now also includes a new method `getDayOfWeekName` that takes an integer value representing the day of the week and a `Locale` object to get the name of the day of week in the specified locale.

        } catch (DateTimeException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Invalid day of week: " + day, e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method now uses a try-catch block to catch the `DateTimeException` that can be thrown if the day of week is invalid. If this exception is caught, a new `DateTimeException` is thrown with a message indicating the invalid day of week.
