Here's the updated Java method that includes error checking and exception handling:

```java
public static void readNextZipEntry(ZipInputStream zipInputStream) throws IOException, ZipException {
    ZipEntry zipEntry = zipInputStream.getNextEntry();
    if (zipEntry == null) {
        throw new ZipException("No more entries in the ZIP file");
    }
    if (zipEntry.isDirectory()) {
        // Skip directory entries
        return;
    }
    long skipped = zipInputStream.skip(zipEntry.getCompressedSize());
    if (skipped != zipEntry.getCompressedSize()) {
        throw new IOException("Failed to skip entry data");
    }
}
```

This method now checks for errors that may occur when using `ZipInputStream.getNextEntry()` and `InputStream.skip()`. If an error occurs, the method throws an appropriate exception.

If `getNextEntry()` returns null, the method throws a `ZipException` with a message indicating that there are no more entries in the ZIP file.

If the entry is a directory, the method simply returns without doing anything.

If `skip()` does not skip the entire entry data, the method throws an `IOException` with a message indicating that it failed to skip the entry data.

Note that this method still assumes that the ZIP file entries are not encrypted. If the entries are encrypted, you will need to use a different approach to read the entry data.
