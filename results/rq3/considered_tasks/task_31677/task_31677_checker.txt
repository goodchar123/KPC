------------------------------------------------------
Is the UnsupportedAudioFileException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `UnsupportedAudioFileException` is declared to be thrown by the `getAudioInputStreamFromUrl()` method, and it is caught and declared to be thrown in the method signature.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `getAudioInputStreamFromUrl()` method, and it is caught and declared to be thrown in the method signature.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the `getAudioInputStreamFromUrl()` method. It may be thrown if the `urlString` argument is `null`, or if the `AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream()` method returns `null`.
