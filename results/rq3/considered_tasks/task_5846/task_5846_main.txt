Please write a java method that Connects this socket to the server.
Sure, here's an example Java method that connects a socket to a server:

```java
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.io.IOException;

public class SocketConnector {
    public static void connectToServer(String serverAddress, int serverPort) {
        try {
            // Create a new socket with the given server address and port
            Socket socket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(serverAddress), serverPort);
            
            // Do something with the socket, such as sending or receiving data
            
            // Close the socket when finished
            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle any exceptions that occur while connecting to the server
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

To use this method, simply call `connectToServer()` with the server address and port as arguments:

```java
SocketConnector.connectToServer("example.com", 1234);
``` 

Note that this method will throw an `IOException` if there is an error connecting to the server, so you should handle this exception appropriately in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a security manager exists             and its checkConnect method doesn't allow the operation for java.net.InetAddress.getByName(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `connectToServer()` method that checks for a security manager and calls its `checkConnect()` method before creating the socket:

```java
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.*;

public class SocketConnector {
    public static void connectToServer(String serverAddress, int serverPort) throws IOException, SecurityException {
        SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (security != null) {
            try {
                security.checkConnect(serverAddress, serverPort);
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Access denied by security manager", e);
            }
        }
        
        try {
            // Create a new socket with the given server address and port
            Socket socket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(serverAddress), serverPort);
            
            // Do something with the socket, such as sending or receiving data
            
            // Close the socket when finished
            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle any exceptions that occur while connecting to the server
            e.printStackTrace();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method first checks if a security manager is present using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager exists, it calls its `checkConnect()` method with the server address and port as arguments. If the operation is not allowed, it throws a `SecurityException` with a message indicating that access was denied by the security manager.

If no security manager is present or the `checkConnect()` method allows the operation, the method proceeds to create the socket as before. If an `IOException` occurs while connecting to the server, it is caught and re-thrown along with its stack trace.
