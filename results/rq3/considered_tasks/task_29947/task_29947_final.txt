
Thank you for bringing this to my attention. You are correct that the `getKey()` and `getValue()` methods of a `Map.Entry` may throw an `IllegalStateException` if the entry has been removed from the backing map. Here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes error handling for this case:

```java
public void writeAttributes(Map<String, String> attributes) {
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : attributes.entrySet()) {
        String name;
        String value;
        try {
            name = entry.getKey();
            value = entry.getValue();
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            // Entry has been removed from the backing map
            continue;
        }
        System.out.println(name + "=" + value);
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we use a try-catch block to handle the `IllegalStateException` that may be thrown by the `getKey()` and `getValue()` methods. If an exception is caught, we simply skip over that entry and move on to the next one.
