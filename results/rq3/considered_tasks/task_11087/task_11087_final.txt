Sure, here's the updated `writeToChannel` method that checks for negative values of `millis`:

```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel;

public void writeToChannel(WritableByteChannel channel, ByteBuffer[] buffers) throws Exception {
    long bytesWritten = 0;
    while (bytesWritten < buffers.length) {
        long bytes = channel.write(buffers);
        if (bytes == 0) {
            // Handle the case where the channel is not ready to write
            // and wait until it is ready
            try {
                Thread.sleep(10);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Restore the interrupted status of the thread
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                throw e;
            }
        }
        bytesWritten += bytes;
    }
}

public void writeToChannelWithChecks(WritableByteChannel channel, ByteBuffer[] buffers, long millis) throws Exception {
    if (millis < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("millis cannot be negative");
    }
    long bytesWritten = 0;
    while (bytesWritten < buffers.length) {
        long bytes = channel.write(buffers);
        if (bytes == 0) {
            // Handle the case where the channel is not ready to write
            // and wait until it is ready
            try {
                Thread.sleep(millis);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Restore the interrupted status of the thread
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                throw e;
            }
        }
        bytesWritten += bytes;
    }
}
```

The `writeToChannelWithChecks` method is the updated version that checks for negative values of `millis`. If `millis` is negative, the method throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. If the thread is interrupted while sleeping, the method throws an `InterruptedException`. 

Note that this method still throws an exception if there is an error while writing to the channel. You can catch this exception and handle it appropriately in your code.
