Please write a java method that Returns an input stream for this socket.
Sure, here's an example Java method that returns an input stream for a given socket:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketUtils {
    public static InputStream getInputStream(Socket socket) throws IOException {
        return socket.getInputStream();
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Socket` object as input and returns an `InputStream` object that can be used to read data from the socket. If an `IOException` occurs while getting the input stream, it will be thrown to the calling method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when creating the             input stream, the socket is closed, the socket is             not connected, or the socket input has been shutdown             using shutdownInput() for java.net.Socket.getInputStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws an `IOException` if any of them occur:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketUtils {
    public static InputStream getInputStream(Socket socket) throws IOException {
        if (socket.isClosed()) {
            throw new IOException("Socket is closed");
        }
        if (!socket.isConnected()) {
            throw new IOException("Socket is not connected");
        }
        if (socket.isInputShutdown()) {
            throw new IOException("Socket input has been shutdown");
        }
        try {
            return socket.getInputStream();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            socket.close();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the socket is closed, not connected, or if the input has been shutdown. If any of these conditions are true, it throws an `IOException` with an appropriate message.

If none of these conditions are true, it attempts to get the input stream from the socket. If an `IOException` occurs while getting the input stream, it closes the socket and re-throws the exception.
