Please write a java method that Retrieves whether inserts made by others are visible.
Here's a Java method that retrieves whether inserts made by others are visible:

```java
public boolean areOthersInsertsVisible(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    return metaData.othersInsertsAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY);
}
```

This method uses the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` class to retrieve the `DatabaseMetaData` object for the database. Then, it calls the `othersInsertsAreVisible()` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` object, passing in `ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY` as the argument to specify the type of result set. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether inserts made by others are visible.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.DatabaseMetaData.othersInsertsAreVisible(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a database access error and throws a `SQLException` if one occurs:

```java
public boolean areOthersInsertsVisible(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    try {
        return metaData.othersInsertsAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Log the error or handle it as appropriate for your application
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving visibility of others' inserts", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that may occur when calling the `othersInsertsAreVisible()` method. If an exception is caught, it throws a new `SQLException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause. This allows the calling code to handle the exception appropriately.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.getMetaData() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a database access error or a closed connection and throws a `SQLException` if either occurs:

```java
public boolean areOthersInsertsVisible(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    try {
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
        return metaData.othersInsertsAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Log the error or handle it as appropriate for your application
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving visibility of others' inserts", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the `Connection` class. If the connection is closed, it throws a new `SQLException` with a custom error message. If the connection is open, it retrieves the `DatabaseMetaData` object using the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` class. If a database access error occurs or the connection is closed during this process, it throws a new `SQLException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause. This allows the calling code to handle the exception appropriately.
