Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error when writing to the output stream using `OutputStream.write(byte[])`:

```java
public void writeAttribute(OutputStream outputStream, String attributeName, String attributeValue) throws IOException {
    String attributeString = attributeName + "=\"" + attributeValue + "\"";
    byte[] attributeBytes = attributeString.getBytes();
    try {
        outputStream.write(attributeBytes);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error writing attribute to output stream", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method is similar to the previous one, but now it wraps the call to `outputStream.write(attributeBytes)` in a try-catch block. If an `IOException` occurs during the write operation, the catch block throws a new `IOException` with a descriptive error message and the original exception as its cause.

By doing this, any errors that occur during the write operation will be properly propagated up the call stack and can be handled appropriately by the calling code.
