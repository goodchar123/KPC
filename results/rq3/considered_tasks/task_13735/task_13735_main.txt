Please write a java method that Removes all of the mappings from this map (optional operation).
Here's a Java method that removes all the mappings from a map:

```java
public void clearMap(Map<String, Integer> map) {
    map.clear();
}
```

This method takes a `Map` object as a parameter and calls the `clear()` method on it to remove all the mappings from the map. Note that the `clear()` method is an optional operation, which means that not all implementations of the `Map` interface may support it.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the clear operation         is not supported by this map for java.util.Map.clear() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the `clear()` operation is supported by the map and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it's not:

```java
public void clearMap(Map<String, Integer> map) {
    if (map instanceof java.util.HashMap) {
        map.clear();
    } else {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Clear operation is not supported by this map.");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the map is an instance of `java.util.HashMap`, which is one of the implementations of the `Map` interface that supports the `clear()` operation. If it is, then the method calls the `clear()` method on the map to remove all the mappings. If it's not, then the method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` with a message indicating that the `clear()` operation is not supported by this map.

    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Clear operation is not supported by this map.");
    }
}
```

This method tries to call the `clear()` method on the map. If the map doesn't support the `clear()` operation, it will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`. In that case, the method catches the exception and throws a new `UnsupportedOperationException` with a message indicating that the `clear()` operation is not supported by this map. If the `clear()` operation is supported, the method will simply remove all the mappings from the map.
