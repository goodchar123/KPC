Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the `clear()` operation is supported by the map and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it's not:

```java
public void clearMap(Map<String, Integer> map) {
    try {
        map.clear();
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Clear operation is not supported by this map.");
    }
}
```

This method tries to call the `clear()` method on the map. If the map doesn't support the `clear()` operation, it will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`. In that case, the method catches the exception and throws a new `UnsupportedOperationException` with a message indicating that the `clear()` operation is not supported by this map. If the `clear()` operation is supported, the method will simply remove all the mappings from the map.
