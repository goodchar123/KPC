Please write a java method that Returns an Object representing the SQL structured type to which this SerialRef object refers.
Here's the Java method that returns an Object representing the SQL structured type to which the SerialRef object refers:

```java
public Object getObject() throws SQLException {
    Struct struct = ref.getStruct();
    return struct.getAttributes();
}
```

This method first retrieves the Struct object associated with the SerialRef object using the `getStruct()` method. Then, it returns the attributes of the Struct object using the `getAttributes()` method. The returned object represents the SQL structured type to which the SerialRef object refers. 

Note that this method throws a SQLException if there is an error accessing the database.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.Struct.getAttributes() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.Struct.getAttributes() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and unsupported methods:

```java
public Object getObject() throws SQLException {
    Struct struct = ref.getStruct();
    try {
        return struct.getAttributes();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error accessing database: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (SQLFeatureNotSupportedException e) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported by JDBC driver: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first retrieves the Struct object associated with the SerialRef object using the `getStruct()` method. Then, it tries to return the attributes of the Struct object using the `getAttributes()` method. If a SQLException occurs, it throws a new SQLException with a custom error message. If a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException occurs, it throws a new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException with a custom error message.

This updated method ensures that any database access errors or unsupported methods are properly handled and reported to the caller.
