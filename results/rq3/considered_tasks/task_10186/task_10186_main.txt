Please write a java method that Reads the requested number of bytes from the input stream into the given byte array.
Here's a Java method that reads the requested number of bytes from an input stream into a given byte array:

```java
public static void readBytes(InputStream inputStream, byte[] buffer, int numBytes) throws IOException {
    int totalBytesRead = 0;
    while (totalBytesRead < numBytes) {
        int bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer, totalBytesRead, numBytes - totalBytesRead);
        if (bytesRead == -1) {
            throw new EOFException("End of stream reached before all bytes could be read");
        }
        totalBytesRead += bytesRead;
    }
}
```

This method takes three parameters:

- `inputStream`: The input stream to read from.
- `buffer`: The byte array to read the bytes into.
- `numBytes`: The number of bytes to read from the input stream.

The method reads bytes from the input stream in a loop until the requested number of bytes have been read or the end of the stream is reached. It uses the `read` method of the input stream to read bytes into the buffer, starting at the current position of `totalBytesRead` and reading up to `numBytes - totalBytesRead` bytes. The number of bytes actually read is returned by the `read` method and added to `totalBytesRead`. If the end of the stream is reached before all bytes could be read, an `EOFException` is thrown.

Note that this method assumes that the byte array is large enough to hold the requested number of bytes. If the byte array is too small, the method will throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If b is null. for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check If off is negative,             len is negative, or len is greater than             b.length   off for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
You're right, it's important to check for null and validate the input parameters in the `readBytes` method. Here's an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```java
public static void readBytes(InputStream inputStream, byte[] buffer, int numBytes) throws IOException {
    Objects.requireNonNull(inputStream, "Input stream cannot be null");
    Objects.requireNonNull(buffer, "Buffer cannot be null");
    if (numBytes < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number of bytes to read cannot be negative");
    }
    if (numBytes > buffer.length) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Number of bytes to read is greater than buffer length");
    }
    int totalBytesRead = 0;
    while (totalBytesRead < numBytes) {
        int bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer, totalBytesRead, numBytes - totalBytesRead);
        if (bytesRead == -1) {
            throw new EOFException("End of stream reached before all bytes could be read");
        }
        totalBytesRead += bytesRead;
    }
}
```

This updated version of the method includes the following changes:

- The `Objects.requireNonNull` method is used to check that the `inputStream` and `buffer` parameters are not null. If either parameter is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a descriptive error message.
- The `numBytes` parameter is checked to ensure that it is not negative. If it is negative, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a descriptive error message.
- The `numBytes` parameter is checked to ensure that it is not greater than the length of the `buffer` parameter starting at the given offset. If it is greater, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown with a descriptive error message.

These checks ensure that the method is called with valid input parameters and that it will not throw unexpected exceptions due to null or invalid input.
