You're right, it's important to check for null and validate the input parameters in the `readBytes` method. Here's an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```java
public static void readBytes(InputStream inputStream, byte[] buffer, int numBytes) throws IOException {
    Objects.requireNonNull(inputStream, "Input stream cannot be null");
    Objects.requireNonNull(buffer, "Buffer cannot be null");
    if (numBytes < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number of bytes to read cannot be negative");
    }
    if (numBytes > buffer.length) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Number of bytes to read is greater than buffer length");
    }
    int totalBytesRead = 0;
    while (totalBytesRead < numBytes) {
        int bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer, totalBytesRead, numBytes - totalBytesRead);
        if (bytesRead == -1) {
            throw new EOFException("End of stream reached before all bytes could be read");
        }
        totalBytesRead += bytesRead;
    }
}
```

This updated version of the method includes the following changes:

- The `Objects.requireNonNull` method is used to check that the `inputStream` and `buffer` parameters are not null. If either parameter is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a descriptive error message.
- The `numBytes` parameter is checked to ensure that it is not negative. If it is negative, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a descriptive error message.
- The `numBytes` parameter is checked to ensure that it is not greater than the length of the `buffer` parameter starting at the given offset. If it is greater, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown with a descriptive error message.

These checks ensure that the method is called with valid input parameters and that it will not throw unexpected exceptions due to null or invalid input.
