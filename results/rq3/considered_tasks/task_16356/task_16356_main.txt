Please write a java method that Acquires in exclusive mode, aborting if interrupted.
Here's an example of a Java method that acquires a lock in exclusive mode and aborts if interrupted:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.LockInterruptedException;

public class ExampleClass {
    private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void acquireLock() throws LockInterruptedException {
        try {
            boolean acquired = lock.tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            if (!acquired) {
                throw new LockInterruptedException("Lock acquisition was interrupted");
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new LockInterruptedException("Lock acquisition was interrupted", e);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we use a `ReentrantLock` to acquire the lock in exclusive mode. We call the `tryLock` method with a timeout of 0 seconds, which means that the method will return immediately if the lock is not available. If the lock is not available, we throw a `LockInterruptedException`. If the thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock, we also throw a `LockInterruptedException`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread is         interrupted while acquiring the lock (and interruption         of lock acquisition is supported) for java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock.lockInterruptibly() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InterruptedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the current thread is interrupted while acquiring the lock using `lockInterruptibly()` and throws an `InterruptedException` if it is interrupted:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.LockInterruptedException;

public class ExampleClass {
    private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void acquireLock() throws LockInterruptedException, InterruptedException {
        try {
            lock.lockInterruptibly();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated example, we use the `lockInterruptibly()` method to acquire the lock in exclusive mode. This method will block until the lock is available, but it will also check if the current thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock. If the thread is interrupted, it will throw an `InterruptedException`. 

We catch the `InterruptedException` and re-interrupt the thread by calling `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`. This is important because it ensures that the interrupted status of the thread is preserved, which allows the caller of this method to handle the interruption appropriately. Finally, we throw the `InterruptedException` to indicate that the lock acquisition was interrupted.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread cannot modify this thread for java.lang.Thread.interrupt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the thread and throws a `SecurityException` if it is not allowed:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.LockInterruptedException;

public class ExampleClass {
    private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void acquireLock() throws LockInterruptedException, InterruptedException, SecurityException {
        try {
            lock.lockInterruptibly();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            throw e;
        }

        if (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            throw new SecurityException("Current thread is not allowed to modify this thread");
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated example, we first acquire the lock using `lockInterruptibly()` as before. After acquiring the lock, we check if the current thread is interrupted using `Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()`. If the thread is not interrupted, we throw a `SecurityException` to indicate that the current thread is not allowed to modify the thread.

This check is important because interrupting a thread can have unintended consequences, and it should only be done by threads that have the appropriate permissions. By throwing a `SecurityException`, we ensure that only threads with the appropriate permissions can interrupt the thread.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread cannot modify this thread for java.lang.Thread.interrupt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
I apologize for the confusion, but my previous response already included the check for whether the current thread is allowed to modify the thread using `Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()`. Here's the updated code snippet with the check:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.LockInterruptedException;

public class ExampleClass {
    private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void acquireLock() throws LockInterruptedException, InterruptedException, SecurityException {
        try {
            lock.lockInterruptibly();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            throw e;
        }

        if (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            throw new SecurityException("Current thread is not allowed to modify this thread");
        }
    }
}
```
