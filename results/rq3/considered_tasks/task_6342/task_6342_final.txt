Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for numeric overflow and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it occurs:

```java
public Duration addDays(Duration duration, long days) {
    try {
        return duration.plusDays(days);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while adding days to duration.");
    }
}
```

This method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may occur when adding days to the duration. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message indicating that a numeric overflow occurred.

By doing this, we can ensure that the method will not return an incorrect result due to numeric overflow, and instead will throw an exception to alert the caller of the issue.
