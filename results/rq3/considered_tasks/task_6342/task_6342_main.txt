Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this duration with the specified duration in standard 24 hour days added.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a duration with the specified duration in standard 24 hour days added:

```java
public Duration addDays(Duration duration, long days) {
    return duration.plusDays(days);
}
```

This method takes in two parameters: the first parameter is the duration that you want to add days to, and the second parameter is the number of days you want to add. The method returns a copy of the original duration with the specified number of days added.

The `plusDays()` method is a built-in method in the `Duration` class that adds the specified number of days to the duration.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.Duration.plusDays(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for numeric overflow and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it occurs:

```java
public Duration addDays(Duration duration, long days) {
    try {
        return duration.plusDays(days);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while adding days to duration.");
    }
}
```

This method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may occur when adding days to the duration. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message indicating that a numeric overflow occurred.

By doing this, we can ensure that the method will not return an incorrect result due to numeric overflow, and instead will throw an exception to alert the caller of the issue.
