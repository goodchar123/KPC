Please write a java method that Description copied from interface:Â Executor
Here is an example of a Java method that implements the Executor interface:

```
import java.util.concurrent.Executor;

public class MyExecutor implements Executor {
    
    @Override
    public void execute(Runnable command) {
        new Thread(command).start();
    }
    
}
```

This implementation of the Executor interface creates a new thread for each task that is submitted to it. The `execute` method takes a `Runnable` object as a parameter and starts a new thread to run the task.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this task cannot be accepted for execution for java.util.concurrent.Executor.execute(java.lang.Runnable) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw RejectedExecutionException.
Please check if command is null for java.util.concurrent.Executor.execute(java.lang.Runnable) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if the thread was already started. for java.lang.Thread.start() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalThreadStateException.
Here is an updated version of the Java method that implements the Executor interface and includes the requested checks:

```
import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
import java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException;

public class MyExecutor implements Executor {
    
    @Override
    public void execute(Runnable command) {
        if (command == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Command cannot be null");
        }
        Thread thread = new Thread(command);
        if (thread.getState() != Thread.State.NEW) {
            throw new IllegalThreadStateException("Thread was already started");
        }
        try {
            thread.start();
        } catch (IllegalThreadStateException e) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task cannot be accepted for execution", e);
        }
    }
    
}
```

This implementation checks if the `command` parameter is null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. It also checks if the thread was already started and throws an `IllegalThreadStateException` if it was. Finally, it catches any `IllegalThreadStateException` that may occur when starting the thread and throws a `RejectedExecutionException` with the original exception as the cause.
