Please write a java method that Sets the position of the text insertion caret for the TextComponent.
Here's a Java method that sets the position of the text insertion caret for a TextComponent:

```java
public void setCaretPosition(TextComponent textComponent, int position) {
    textComponent.setCaretPosition(position);
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the TextComponent object and the position where you want to set the caret. The setCaretPosition() method of the TextComponent class is used to set the position of the caret.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if position               is less than zero for java.awt.TextComponent.setCaretPosition(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the position is less than zero and throws an IllegalArgumentException if it is:

```java
public void setCaretPosition(TextComponent textComponent, int position) {
    if (position < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Position cannot be less than zero.");
    }
    textComponent.setCaretPosition(position);
}
```

This method first checks if the position is less than zero using an if statement. If it is, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a message "Position cannot be less than zero." If the position is valid, the setCaretPosition() method of the TextComponent class is used to set the position of the caret.
