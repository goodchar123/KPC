Sure, here's an updated version of the `addElementToStream` method that checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state before adding an element. If the builder has already been built, it throws an `IllegalStateException`:

```java
public static void addElementToStream(Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder, String element) {
    if (streamBuilder.build().isParallel()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Builder has already transitioned to the built state");
    }
    streamBuilder.add(element);
}
```

This method first checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state by calling the `build()` method and checking if the resulting stream is parallel. If it is, then the builder has already been built and an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

If the builder has not been built, then the element is added to the stream using the `add()` method of the `Stream.Builder` class.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder = Stream.builder();
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "apple");
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "banana");
Stream<String> stream = streamBuilder.build();
```

This will create a stream with the elements "apple" and "banana". If you try to add an element after the builder has been built, like this:

```java
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "orange");
```

Then an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown.
