Please write a java method that Adds an element to the stream being built.
Here's an example Java method that adds an element to a stream being built:

```java
public static void addElementToStream(Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder, String element) {
    streamBuilder.add(element);
}
```

This method takes in a `Stream.Builder` object and a `String` element as parameters. It then adds the element to the stream being built using the `add()` method of the `Stream.Builder` class. 

You can call this method like this:

```java
Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder = Stream.builder();
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "apple");
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "banana");
Stream<String> stream = streamBuilder.build();
```

This will create a stream with the elements "apple" and "banana".

Please check if the builder has already transitioned to the built state for java.util.stream.Stream.Builder.build() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `addElementToStream` method that checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state before adding an element. If the builder has already been built, it throws an `IllegalStateException`:

```java
public static void addElementToStream(Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder, String element) {
    if (streamBuilder.build().isParallel()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Builder has already transitioned to the built state");
    }
    streamBuilder.add(element);
}
```

This method first checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state by calling the `build()` method and checking if the resulting stream is parallel. If it is, then the builder has already been built and an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

If the builder has not been built, then the element is added to the stream using the `add()` method of the `Stream.Builder` class.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder = Stream.builder();
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "apple");
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "banana");
Stream<String> stream = streamBuilder.build();
```

This will create a stream with the elements "apple" and "banana". If you try to add an element after the builder has been built, like this:

```java
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "orange");
```

Then an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown.
