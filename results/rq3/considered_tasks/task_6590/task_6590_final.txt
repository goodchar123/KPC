Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the exceptions you mentioned:

```java
public static int getValueFromYearMonth(YearMonth yearMonth, TemporalField field) {
    try {
        return yearMonth.get(field);
    } catch (DateTimeException | UnsupportedTemporalTypeException | ArithmeticException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may be thrown by the `get` method of the `YearMonth` class. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown using the `throw` keyword.

The `DateTimeException` is thrown if a value for the field cannot be obtained or the value is outside the range of valid values for the field. The `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` is thrown if the field is not supported or the range of values exceeds an int. The `ArithmeticException` is thrown if numeric overflow occurs.

By catching and re-throwing these exceptions, the method ensures that any errors are properly handled and propagated up the call stack.
