Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of them are true:

```java
public void appendSubsequence(Writer writer, CharSequence charSequence, int start, int end) throws IOException, IndexOutOfBoundsException {
    int length = charSequence.length();
    if (start < 0 || end < 0 || start > end || end > length) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    writer.append(charSequence, start, end);
}
```

This method first checks if `start` or `end` are negative, if `start` is greater than `end`, or if `end` is greater than the length of the `CharSequence`. If any of these conditions are true, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

If none of these conditions are true, it calls the `append` method of the `Writer` object, passing in the `CharSequence` object and the starting and ending indices to append the specified subsequence to the writer.

Note that this method still throws an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs while writing to the writer.
