
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the input stream reaches the end before reading eight bytes and also checks for any I/O errors:

```java
public double readNextAttribute(DataInputStream stream) throws IOException {
    if (stream == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Input stream is null");
    }
    if (stream.available() < 8) {
        throw new EOFException("End of stream reached before reading eight bytes");
    }
    try {
        return stream.readDouble();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        if (e.getMessage().equals("Stream closed")) {
            throw new IOException("Input stream has been closed", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the input stream is null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. Then it checks if the number of bytes available in the input stream is less than 8 (the size of a double). If it is, then an `EOFException` is thrown to indicate that the end of the stream has been reached before the next attribute could be read.

The method then tries to read the next eight bytes from the stream using `readDouble()` method. If an `IOException` is thrown, it checks if the message of the exception is "Stream closed". If it is, then it throws a new `IOException` with a more descriptive message. Otherwise, it re-throws the original exception.
