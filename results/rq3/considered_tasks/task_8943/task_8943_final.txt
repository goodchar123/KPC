I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks if a security manager exists and if shutting down the `ExecutorService` may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify:

```
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, CancellationException, SecurityException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<String> future = executor.submit(new Callable<String>() {
            public String call() throws Exception {
                // Perform some long-running task here
                return "Task completed successfully!";
            }
        });
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            try {
                sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                executor.shutdownNow();
                throw new SecurityException("Cannot modify threads.", e);
            }
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            String result = future.get();
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (CancellationException e) {
            System.out.println("Computation was cancelled.");
        } catch (ExecutionException e) {
            System.out.println("Computation threw an exception.");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread was interrupted while waiting for computation.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if a security manager exists using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager exists, we then check if the caller has the `RuntimePermission("modifyThread")` permission using `SecurityManager.checkPermission()`. If the permission is not granted, we throw a `SecurityException` indicating that the caller cannot modify threads.

Note that we also added `SecurityException` to the list of exceptions thrown by the `main()` method. This is because we are now potentially throwing this exception if the caller does not have the necessary permission to modify threads. Additionally, we use `executor.shutdownNow()` instead of `executor.shutdown()` to immediately stop the execution of any running tasks if a `SecurityException` is thrown.
