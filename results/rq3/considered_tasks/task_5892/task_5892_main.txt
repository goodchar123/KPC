Please write a java method that Returns the server's certificate chain, which was established as part of defining the session in the original connection that retrieved the network resource, from cache.
Here's a Java method that returns the server's certificate chain from cache:

```java
import java.net.*;
import javax.net.ssl.*;

public class CertificateChainFromCache {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com");
        HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        conn.setUseCaches(true);
        conn.connect();
        SSLSession session = conn.getSSLSession();
        Certificate[] certs = session.getPeerCertificates();
        for (Certificate cert : certs) {
            System.out.println(cert);
        }
    }
}
```

This method establishes a connection to the specified URL using `HttpsURLConnection`, sets the `useCaches` property to `true` to enable caching, and retrieves the SSL session using `getSSLSession()`. The `getPeerCertificates()` method of the `SSLSession` class returns an array of `Certificate` objects representing the server's certificate chain. The method then prints out each certificate in the chain.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O exception occurs. for java.net.URL.openConnection() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if this method is called before           the connection has been established for javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection.getSSLSession() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if the peer's identity has not          been verified for javax.net.ssl.SSLSession.getPeerCertificates() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SSLPeerUnverifiedException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested exception handling:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.*;
import javax.net.ssl.*;

public class CertificateChainFromCache {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com");
        HttpsURLConnection conn;
        try {
            conn = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error opening connection: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        conn.setUseCaches(true);
        conn.connect();
        SSLSession session = conn.getSSLSession();
        if (session == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("SSL session not established");
        }
        Certificate[] certs;
        try {
            certs = session.getPeerCertificates();
        } catch (SSLPeerUnverifiedException e) {
            throw new SSLPeerUnverifiedException("Peer identity not verified: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        for (Certificate cert : certs) {
            System.out.println(cert);
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method includes exception handling for the three scenarios you mentioned. If an `IOException` occurs when opening the connection, the method throws a new `IOException` with a descriptive error message. If `getSSLSession()` is called before the connection has been established, the method throws an `IllegalStateException`. If `getPeerCertificates()` is called and the peer's identity has not been verified, the method throws an `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` with a descriptive error message.
