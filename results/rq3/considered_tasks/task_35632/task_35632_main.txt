Please write a java method that Clears the global focus owner at both the Java and native levels.
Here's a Java method that clears the global focus owner at both the Java and native levels:

```java
public static void clearGlobalFocusOwner() {
    KeyboardFocusManager manager = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager();
    manager.clearGlobalFocusOwner();
    manager.clearGlobalFocusOwnerNative();
}
```

This method first gets the current keyboard focus manager using the `getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager()` method. It then calls the `clearGlobalFocusOwner()` method to clear the global focus owner at the Java level. Finally, it calls the `clearGlobalFocusOwnerNative()` method to clear the global focus owner at the native level.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the calling thread does not have         "replaceKeyboardFocusManager" permission for java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager.clearGlobalFocusOwner() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for the "replaceKeyboardFocusManager" permission and throws a SecurityException if the calling thread doesn't have it:

```java
public static void clearGlobalFocusOwner() throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new AWTPermission("replaceKeyboardFocusManager"));
    }
    KeyboardFocusManager manager = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager();
    manager.clearGlobalFocusOwner();
    manager.clearGlobalFocusOwnerNative();
}
```

This code first checks if there is a SecurityManager present using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If there is, it checks for the "replaceKeyboardFocusManager" permission using the `checkPermission()` method of the SecurityManager. If the permission is not granted, a SecurityException is thrown.

If the permission is granted, the method proceeds to clear the global focus owner at both the Java and native levels using the same code as before.
