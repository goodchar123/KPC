
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error during the write operation and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
public void write64BitsToStream(OutputStream stream, long v) throws IOException {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[8];
    buffer[0] = (byte) (v >>> 56);
    buffer[1] = (byte) (v >>> 48);
    buffer[2] = (byte) (v >>> 40);
    buffer[3] = (byte) (v >>> 32);
    buffer[4] = (byte) (v >>> 24);
    buffer[5] = (byte) (v >>> 16);
    buffer[6] = (byte) (v >>> 8);
    buffer[7] = (byte) v;
    try {
        stream.write(buffer);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error writing to stream", e);
    }
}
```

This method is similar to the previous one, but it now includes a try-catch block around the `write()` method call. If an `IOException` occurs during the write operation, it is caught and re-thrown as a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. This way, the calling method can handle the exception appropriately.
