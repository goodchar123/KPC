Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for I/O errors and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileHelper {
    public static void writeBytesToFile(byte[] data, String filename, int offset, int len) throws IOException {
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(filename);
        try {
            fos.write(data, offset, len);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing bytes to file: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                fos.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error closing file: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we've added a `try-catch` block around the `write` method call to catch any `IOException` that might occur. If an `IOException` is caught, we throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message.

We've also added a `finally` block to ensure that the `FileOutputStream` is always closed, even if an exception is thrown. Inside the `finally` block, we've added another `try-catch` block to catch any `IOException` that might occur when closing the file. If an `IOException` is caught, we throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message.
