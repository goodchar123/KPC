List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
The fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above are:

1. `java.io.FileOutputStream.FileOutputStream(String)` - creates a new `FileOutputStream` object with the specified filename.
2. `java.io.FileOutputStream.write(byte[], int, int)` - writes a portion of a byte array to the output stream.
3. `java.io.FileOutputStream.close()` - closes the output stream.

 + From response, we get: ['java.io.FileOutputStream.FileOutputStream(String)', 'java.io.FileOutputStream.write(byte[],int,int)', 'java.io.FileOutputStream.close()']

Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.FileOutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `writeBytesToFile` method, but it is not handled or caught within the method itself.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.FileOutputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `close` method, but it is not handled or caught within the `writeBytesToFile` method itself.

Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.FileOutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block surrounding the `fos.write(data, offset, len)` method call.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.FileOutputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block inside the `finally` block surrounding the `fos.close()` method call.
