
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
public boolean supportsCorrelatedSubqueries(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed.");
    }
    
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = null;
    try {
        metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve database metadata.", e);
    }
    
    try {
        return metaData.supportsCorrelatedSubqueries();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to determine whether the database supports correlated subqueries.", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `Connection` object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the connection is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

Next, it retrieves the `DatabaseMetaData` object using the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` object. If a `SQLException` is thrown during this process, it throws a new `SQLException` with an appropriate error message and the original exception as the cause.

Finally, it calls the `supportsCorrelatedSubqueries()` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` object to determine whether the database supports correlated subqueries. If a `SQLException` is thrown during this process, it throws a new `SQLException` with an appropriate error message and the original exception as the cause.
