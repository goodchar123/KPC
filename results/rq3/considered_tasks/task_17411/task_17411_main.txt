Please write a java method that Reads an SQL DATALINK value from the stream and returns it as an URL object in the Java programming language.
Here's a Java method that reads an SQL DATALINK value from the stream and returns it as a URL object:

```java
public static URL readDatalinkValue(InputStream stream) throws SQLException {
    try {
        byte[] bytes = stream.readAllBytes();
        String urlStr = new String(bytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        return new URL(urlStr);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error reading DATALINK value from stream", e);
    }
}
```

This method reads all the bytes from the input stream and converts them to a string using the UTF-8 character set. It then creates a new URL object from the string and returns it. If there is an error reading the bytes from the stream, a SQLException is thrown.

Please check if an I/O error occurs for java.io.InputStream.readAllBytes() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if an array of the required size cannot be         allocated. for java.io.InputStream.readAllBytes() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw OutOfMemoryError.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for I/O errors and OutOfMemoryErrors when using `InputStream.readAllBytes()`:

```java
public static URL readDatalinkValue(InputStream stream) throws SQLException, IOException {
    try {
        byte[] bytes = stream.readAllBytes();
        String urlStr = new String(bytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
        return new URL(urlStr);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error reading DATALINK value from stream", e);
    } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
        throw new OutOfMemoryError("Error reading DATALINK value from stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated version of the method catches both `IOException` and `OutOfMemoryError` exceptions that can be thrown by `InputStream.readAllBytes()`. If an `IOException` is caught, a `SQLException` is thrown with the original exception as the cause. If an `OutOfMemoryError` is caught, an `OutOfMemoryError` is thrown with a message that includes the original error message.
