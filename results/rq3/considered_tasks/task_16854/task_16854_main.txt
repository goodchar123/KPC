Please write a java method that Returns a BigDecimal whose value is (this / divisor), and whose preferred scale is (this.scale() - divisor.scale()); if the exact quotient cannot be represented (because it has a non-terminating decimal expansion) an ArithmeticException is thrown.
Here's the Java method that you requested:

```java
public BigDecimal divideWithPreferredScale(BigDecimal divisor) {
    int preferredScale = this.scale() - divisor.scale();
    return this.divide(divisor, preferredScale, RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY);
}
```

This method takes a `BigDecimal` divisor as input and returns a `BigDecimal` quotient whose preferred scale is calculated as the difference between the scale of the dividend and the scale of the divisor. The `divide` method is called with the preferred scale and `RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY` to ensure that an `ArithmeticException` is thrown if the exact quotient cannot be represented.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if divisor is zero,         roundingMode==RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY and         the specified scale is insufficient to represent the result         of the division exactly. for java.math.BigDecimal.divide(java.math.BigDecimal,int,java.math.RoundingMode) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned:

```java
public BigDecimal divideWithPreferredScale(BigDecimal divisor) {
    int preferredScale = this.scale() - divisor.scale();
    BigDecimal result = this.divide(divisor, preferredScale, RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY);
    if (divisor.equals(BigDecimal.ZERO)) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Divisor cannot be zero");
    } else if (result.scale() < preferredScale) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Insufficient scale to represent the result exactly");
    } else if (RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY.equals(RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY)) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Rounding mode cannot be UNNECESSARY");
    }
    return result;
}
```

This method first calculates the preferred scale as before. It then calls the `divide` method with the preferred scale and `RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY` to get the quotient. 

After that, it checks for the conditions you mentioned. If the divisor is zero, it throws an `ArithmeticException` with an appropriate message. If the scale of the quotient is less than the preferred scale, it means that the exact quotient cannot be represented, so it throws an `ArithmeticException` with an appropriate message. Finally, if the rounding mode is `RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY`, it throws an `ArithmeticException` with an appropriate message.
