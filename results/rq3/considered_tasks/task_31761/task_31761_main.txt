Please write a java method that Obtains the set of all target lines currently open from this mixer.
Here's a Java method that obtains the set of all target lines currently open from a mixer:

```java
import javax.sound.sampled.*;

public Set<TargetDataLine> getOpenTargetLines(Mixer mixer) {
    Set<TargetDataLine> openLines = new HashSet<>();
    Line.Info[] targetLineInfo = mixer.getTargetLineInfo();
    for (Line.Info info : targetLineInfo) {
        try {
            Line line = mixer.getLine(info);
            if (line instanceof TargetDataLine && line.isOpen()) {
                openLines.add((TargetDataLine) line);
            }
        } catch (LineUnavailableException e) {
            // handle exception
        }
    }
    return openLines;
}
```

This method takes a `Mixer` object as input and returns a `Set` of all currently open `TargetDataLine` objects associated with that mixer. It first obtains an array of `Line.Info` objects for all target lines supported by the mixer using the `getTargetLineInfo()` method. It then iterates through this array and attempts to obtain a `Line` object for each line using the `getLine()` method. If the line is a `TargetDataLine` and is currently open, it is added to the `openLines` set. Finally, the method returns the set of open target lines.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this mixer does not support any lines         matching the description for javax.sound.sampled.Mixer.getLine(javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if a matching line is not available due to         security restrictions for javax.sound.sampled.Mixer.getLine(javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
import javax.sound.sampled.*;

public Set<TargetDataLine> getOpenTargetLines(Mixer mixer) throws IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException {
    Set<TargetDataLine> openLines = new HashSet<>();
    Line.Info[] targetLineInfo = mixer.getTargetLineInfo();
    for (Line.Info info : targetLineInfo) {
        try {
            Line line = mixer.getLine(info);
            if (line instanceof TargetDataLine && line.isOpen()) {
                openLines.add((TargetDataLine) line);
            }
        } catch (LineUnavailableException e) {
            // handle exception
            if (e instanceof IllegalArgumentException) {
                throw (IllegalArgumentException) e;
            } else if (e instanceof SecurityException) {
                throw (SecurityException) e;
            }
        }
    }
    return openLines;
}
```

This updated method includes two checks:

1. If the `getLine()` method throws an `IllegalArgumentException`, it is re-thrown as an `IllegalArgumentException` to indicate that the mixer does not support any lines matching the provided `Line.Info` description.

2. If the `getLine()` method throws a `SecurityException`, it is re-thrown as a `SecurityException` to indicate that a matching line is not available due to security restrictions.

These checks are implemented using `instanceof` to determine the type of the caught exception and then re-throwing it with the appropriate type.
