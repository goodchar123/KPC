The code snippet I provided earlier already includes a check for `TransformerConfigurationException` when creating a new `Transformer` object based on the provided `Templates`. Here's the relevant part of the code:

```
// Create a new Transformer object based on the provided Templates
Transformer transformer = templates.newTransformer();
```

If a `TransformerConfigurationException` occurs during this step, it will be thrown from the method.
