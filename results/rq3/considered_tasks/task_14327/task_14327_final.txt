Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for all the exceptions you mentioned:

```
public static void removeElements(List<Object> list, int fromIndex, int toIndex) {
    List<Object> subList = list.subList(fromIndex, toIndex);
    if (subList instanceof RandomAccess || subList.size() < 1000) {
        subList.clear();
    } else {
        for (Iterator<Object> it = subList.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
            Object element;
            try {
                element = it.next();
            } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
                throw new NoSuchElementException("Iterator has no more elements");
            }
            try {
                it.remove();
            } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Remove operation is not supported by this iterator");
            } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Next method has not yet been called, or the remove method has already been called after the last call to the next method");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method uses try-catch blocks to catch the `NoSuchElementException`, `UnsupportedOperationException`, and `IllegalStateException` exceptions that may be thrown by the iterator's `next()` and `remove()` methods.

If the `NoSuchElementException` exception is caught, it throws a new `NoSuchElementException` with a custom message indicating that the iterator has no more elements.

If the `UnsupportedOperationException` exception is caught, it throws a new `UnsupportedOperationException` with a custom message indicating that the remove operation is not supported by the iterator.

If the `IllegalStateException` exception is caught, it throws a new `IllegalStateException` with a custom message indicating that the next method has not yet been called, or the remove method has already been called after the last call to the next method.

Before calling the `remove()` method on the iterator, the method stores the next element in a variable to ensure that the `NoSuchElementException` exception is caught before the `remove()` method is called.
