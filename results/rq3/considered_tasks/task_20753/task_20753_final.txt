
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public void setMaxRows(int maxRows) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed.");
    }
    try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {
        stmt.setMaxRows(maxRows);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

In this updated method, we first check if the connection is closed. If it is, we throw a SQLException with an appropriate error message.

Next, we create a new Statement object using a try-with-resources block. This ensures that the Statement object is automatically closed after the try block is executed, even if an exception occurs.

We then set the maximum number of rows using the `setMaxRows()` method.

If a SQLException occurs, we simply re-throw it.

This updated method should handle all the error conditions you specified.
