Please write a java method that Returns the SplashScreen object used for Java startup splash screen control on systems that support display.
Here's a Java method that returns the SplashScreen object used for Java startup splash screen control on systems that support display:

```java
import java.awt.SplashScreen;

public class SplashScreenHelper {
    public static SplashScreen getSplashScreen() {
        return SplashScreen.getSplashScreen();
    }
}
```

This method simply calls the static `getSplashScreen()` method of the `SplashScreen` class, which returns the `SplashScreen` object used for Java startup splash screen control on systems that support display. If no splash screen is displayed, this method returns `null`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the splash screen feature is not         supported by the current toolkit for java.awt.SplashScreen.getSplashScreen() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Please check if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()         returns true for java.awt.SplashScreen.getSplashScreen() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw HeadlessException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the splash screen feature is supported and if the environment is headless before returning the `SplashScreen` object:

```java
import java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment;
import java.awt.SplashScreen;

public class SplashScreenHelper {
    public static SplashScreen getSplashScreen() {
        if (!GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()) {
            SplashScreen splashScreen = SplashScreen.getSplashScreen();
            if (splashScreen != null) {
                return splashScreen;
            } else {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Splash screen not supported");
            }
        } else {
            throw new HeadlessException("Environment is headless");
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the environment is headless by calling `GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()`. If it returns `true`, a `HeadlessException` is thrown. If the environment is not headless, the method then calls `SplashScreen.getSplashScreen()` to get the `SplashScreen` object. If the object is not `null`, it is returned. If the object is `null`, it means that the splash screen feature is not supported, so an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown.
