
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the splash screen feature is supported and if the environment is headless before returning the `SplashScreen` object:

```java
import java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment;
import java.awt.SplashScreen;

public class SplashScreenHelper {
    public static SplashScreen getSplashScreen() {
        if (!GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()) {
            SplashScreen splashScreen = SplashScreen.getSplashScreen();
            if (splashScreen != null) {
                return splashScreen;
            } else {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Splash screen not supported");
            }
        } else {
            throw new HeadlessException("Environment is headless");
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the environment is headless by calling `GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()`. If it returns `true`, a `HeadlessException` is thrown. If the environment is not headless, the method then calls `SplashScreen.getSplashScreen()` to get the `SplashScreen` object. If the object is not `null`, it is returned. If the object is `null`, it means that the splash screen feature is not supported, so an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown.
