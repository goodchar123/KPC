Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for errors in the underlying protocol and throws a `SocketException` if there is an error:

```java
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketException;

public class SocketHelper {
    public static int getSoLinger(Socket socket) throws SocketException {
        try {
            return socket.getSoLinger();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new SocketException("Error in underlying protocol: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This method now catches any exception that may occur while getting the SO_LINGER setting and throws a `SocketException` with a message indicating that there was an error in the underlying protocol.
