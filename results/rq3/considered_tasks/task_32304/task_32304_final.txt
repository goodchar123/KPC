
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the necessary exception handling:

```java
public synchronized void retainOnlyChildren(Set<Unsupported> specifiedChildren) {
    try {
        Set<Unsupported> childrenCopy = new HashSet<>(children);
        for (Iterator<Unsupported> iterator = childrenCopy.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
            Unsupported child = iterator.next();
            if (!specifiedChildren.contains(child)) {
                iterator.remove();
            }
        }
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        throw new ClassCastException("Type of specified element is incompatible with this set");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Specified element is null and this set does not permit null elements");
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Remove operation is not supported by this set");
    } catch (IllegalMonitorStateException e) {
        throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Current thread is not the owner of the object's monitor");
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        throw new InterruptedException("Thread was interrupted while waiting");
    } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("Iteration has no more elements");
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we've added try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions that may be thrown by the various methods used in the implementation. 

For example, if the specified element is not of the correct type, a ClassCastException will be thrown and we catch it to provide a more informative error message. Similarly, if the set does not permit null elements and a null element is specified, a NullPointerException will be thrown and we catch it to provide a more informative error message.

We've also added exception handling for the wait() and notifyAll() methods, which may be called implicitly by the synchronized block. If the current thread is not the owner of the object's monitor, an IllegalMonitorStateException will be thrown.

Finally, we've added exception handling for the Iterator's next() method, which may throw a NoSuchElementException if there are no more elements in the iteration.
