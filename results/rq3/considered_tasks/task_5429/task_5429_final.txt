Sure, here's an updated version of the `getChildrenNames()` method that checks for all the required conditions:

```java
public static String[] getChildrenNames(Preferences node) throws BackingStoreException {
    if (node.isRemoved()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Node has been removed");
    }
    try {
        node.sync();
    } catch (BackingStoreException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Failed to sync with backing store", e);
    }
    if (node.isRemoved()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Node has been removed");
    }
    String[] childrenNames;
    try {
        childrenNames = node.childrenNames();
    } catch (BackingStoreException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Failed to get children names", e);
    }
    return childrenNames;
}
```

This updated method first checks if the input node or any of its ancestors have been removed using the `isRemoved()` method. If the node has been removed, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown with an appropriate error message. If the node is still valid, the method proceeds to sync with the backing store using the `sync()` method. If there is a failure in the backing store, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown with an appropriate error message and the original exception as the cause. If the sync is successful, the method proceeds to check if the input node or any of its ancestors have been removed again using the `isRemoved()` method. If the node has been removed, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown with an appropriate error message. If the node is still valid, the method proceeds to get the names of its children using the `childrenNames()` method. If there is a failure in getting the children names, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown with an appropriate error message and the original exception as the cause. Finally, the method returns the children names as an array of strings.
