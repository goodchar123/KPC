Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error during the flushing process and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
public void flushCompressedOutputStream(DeflaterOutputStream compressedOutputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        compressedOutputStream.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while flushing the compressed output stream.", e);
    }
}
```

This method now uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur during the flushing process. If an `IOException` is caught, it is re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.
