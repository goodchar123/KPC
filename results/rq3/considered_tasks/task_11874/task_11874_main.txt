Please write a java method that Flushes the compressed output stream.
Here's a Java method that flushes the compressed output stream:

```java
public void flushCompressedOutputStream(DeflaterOutputStream compressedOutputStream) throws IOException {
    compressedOutputStream.flush();
}
```

This method takes a `DeflaterOutputStream` as input and calls its `flush()` method to flush the compressed output stream. If an `IOException` occurs during the flushing process, it will be thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error has occurred for java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.flush() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error during the flushing process and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
public void flushCompressedOutputStream(DeflaterOutputStream compressedOutputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        compressedOutputStream.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while flushing the compressed output stream.", e);
    }
}
```

This method now uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur during the flushing process. If an `IOException` is caught, it is re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.
