Please write a java method that Overrides FilterInputStream.reset to reset the progress monitor as well as the stream.
Here's an example Java method that overrides FilterInputStream.reset to reset the progress monitor as well as the stream:

```java
import java.io.FilterInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import javax.swing.ProgressMonitorInputStream;

public class ProgressMonitorResetInputStream extends FilterInputStream {

    private ProgressMonitorInputStream progressMonitorInputStream;

    public ProgressMonitorResetInputStream(InputStream in, ProgressMonitorInputStream progressMonitorInputStream) {
        super(in);
        this.progressMonitorInputStream = progressMonitorInputStream;
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void reset() throws IOException {
        super.reset();
        progressMonitorInputStream.getProgressMonitor().setProgress(0);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new class called `ProgressMonitorResetInputStream` that extends `FilterInputStream`. We also pass in a `ProgressMonitorInputStream` object to the constructor.

The `reset()` method is then overridden to call the `reset()` method of the superclass (i.e. `FilterInputStream`) and reset the progress monitor to 0 using the `setProgress()` method of the `ProgressMonitor` object.

Note that this example assumes that the `ProgressMonitorInputStream` object has already been created and initialized elsewhere in the code.

Please check if the stream has not been marked or if the               mark has been invalidated. for java.io.FilterInputStream.reset() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
You're right, it's important to check if the stream has been marked or if the mark has been invalidated before calling `reset()` on the superclass. Here's the updated code snippet that includes this check:

```java
import java.io.FilterInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import javax.swing.ProgressMonitorInputStream;

public class ProgressMonitorResetInputStream extends FilterInputStream {

    private ProgressMonitorInputStream progressMonitorInputStream;

    public ProgressMonitorResetInputStream(InputStream in, ProgressMonitorInputStream progressMonitorInputStream) {
        super(in);
        this.progressMonitorInputStream = progressMonitorInputStream;
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void reset() throws IOException {
        if (!super.markSupported()) {
            throw new IOException("Mark not supported");
        }
        if (super.markpos < 0) {
            throw new IOException("Mark invalidated");
        }
        super.reset();
        progressMonitorInputStream.getProgressMonitor().setProgress(0);
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we first check if the mark is supported by calling `markSupported()` on the superclass. If it's not supported, we throw an `IOException` with a message indicating that the mark is not supported.

If the mark is supported, we then check if the mark position is negative, which indicates that the mark has been invalidated. If it's invalidated, we throw an `IOException` with a message indicating that the mark has been invalidated.

If the mark is valid, we call `reset()` on the superclass and reset the progress monitor as before.
