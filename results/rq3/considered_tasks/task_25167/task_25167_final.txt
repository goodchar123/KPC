
You're right, it's important to check if the stream has been marked or if the mark has been invalidated before calling `reset()` on the superclass. Here's the updated code snippet that includes this check:

```java
import java.io.FilterInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import javax.swing.ProgressMonitorInputStream;

public class ProgressMonitorResetInputStream extends FilterInputStream {

    private ProgressMonitorInputStream progressMonitorInputStream;

    public ProgressMonitorResetInputStream(InputStream in, ProgressMonitorInputStream progressMonitorInputStream) {
        super(in);
        this.progressMonitorInputStream = progressMonitorInputStream;
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void reset() throws IOException {
        if (!super.markSupported()) {
            throw new IOException("Mark not supported");
        }
        if (super.markpos < 0) {
            throw new IOException("Mark invalidated");
        }
        super.reset();
        progressMonitorInputStream.getProgressMonitor().setProgress(0);
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we first check if the mark is supported by calling `markSupported()` on the superclass. If it's not supported, we throw an `IOException` with a message indicating that the mark is not supported.

If the mark is supported, we then check if the mark position is negative, which indicates that the mark has been invalidated. If it's invalidated, we throw an `IOException` with a message indicating that the mark has been invalidated.

If the mark is valid, we call `reset()` on the superclass and reset the progress monitor as before.
