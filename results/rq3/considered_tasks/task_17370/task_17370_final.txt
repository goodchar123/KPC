Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes all the requested error checks:

```java
public void writeAsciiStream(SQLOutputImpl output, InputStream inputStream) throws SQLException, IOException {
    if (inputStream == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Input stream cannot be null");
    }
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int bytesRead;
    try {
        while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            String asciiString = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead, "US-ASCII");
            try {
                output.writeString(asciiString);
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred", e);
            } catch (SQLFeatureNotSupportedException e) {
                throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support this method", e);
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error reading input stream", e);
    }
}
```

This updated code includes the following error checks:

- Checks if the `inputStream` parameter is null before reading from it. If it is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
- Checks if the first byte cannot be read for any reason other than the end of the file, if the input stream has been closed, or if some other I/O error occurs. If any of these conditions are met, an `IOException` is thrown.
- Checks if a database access error occurs when calling the `writeString` method. If so, a new `SQLException` is thrown with the original exception as the cause.
- Checks if the JDBC driver does not support the `writeString` method. If so, a new `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown with the original exception as the cause.
