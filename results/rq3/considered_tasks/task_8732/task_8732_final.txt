Sure, here's an updated version of the `contains` method that includes the requested checks and exceptions:

```
public boolean contains(Object element) {
    if (element == null && !allowNullElements) {
        throw new NullPointerException("This list does not permit null elements.");
    }
    try {
        return elements.contains(element);
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        throw new ClassCastException("Type of specified element is incompatible with this list.");
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the element is null and if null elements are not allowed in the list, it throws a `NullPointerException`. It then attempts to check if the list contains the element using the `contains` method of the `elements` list. If a `ClassCastException` is thrown during this process, the method catches it and re-throws it with a more descriptive message.
