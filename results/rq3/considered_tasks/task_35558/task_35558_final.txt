
Sure, here's an updated version of the `canDisplay()` method that checks for the condition you mentioned:

```java
public static boolean canDisplay(Font font, int codePoint) {
    if (codePoint < 0 || codePoint > 0x10FFFF) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid Unicode code point: " + codePoint);
    }
    return font.canDisplay(codePoint);
}
```

This updated version of the `canDisplay()` method checks if the code point is less than 0 or greater than 0x10FFFF, which are the valid ranges for Unicode code points. If the code point is outside this range, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating the error.

Note that this check is not strictly necessary for the `canDisplay()` method to work correctly, but it provides an additional layer of validation to ensure that only valid code points are passed to the `canDisplay()` method.
