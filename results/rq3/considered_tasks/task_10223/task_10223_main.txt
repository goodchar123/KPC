Please write a java method that Writes b.length bytes from the specified byte array to this file, starting at the current file pointer.
Here's a Java method that writes bytes from a byte array to a file:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileHelper {
    public static void writeBytesToFile(File file, byte[] bytes) throws IOException {
        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file, true)) {
            fos.write(bytes);
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes two parameters: a `File` object representing the file to write to, and a `byte[]` array containing the bytes to write. The `true` parameter in the `FileOutputStream` constructor specifies that the bytes should be appended to the end of the file, rather than overwriting its contents.

The `write()` method of the `FileOutputStream` class is used to write the bytes to the file. This method writes the entire byte array to the file, starting at the current file pointer.

Note that this method throws an `IOException` if there is an error writing to the file. You should handle this exception appropriately in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.FileOutputStream.write(byte[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error when writing bytes to a file using `java.io.FileOutputStream.write(byte[])`:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileHelper {
    public static void writeBytesToFile(File file, byte[] bytes) throws IOException {
        try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file, true)) {
            fos.write(bytes);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing bytes to file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated method, we've added a `catch` block to catch any `IOException` that might occur when writing bytes to the file. If an `IOException` is caught, we throw a new `IOException` with a custom error message that includes the original exception's message.

This way, if an I/O error occurs while writing bytes to the file, the method will throw an `IOException` with a clear error message that can be used to diagnose the problem.
