Please write a java method that Writes a string to the underlying output stream as a sequence of characters.
Here's an example Java method that writes a string to the underlying output stream:

```java
public void writeStringToOutputStream(String str, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    byte[] bytes = str.getBytes();
    outputStream.write(bytes);
}
```

This method takes in two parameters: the string to be written (`str`) and the output stream to write to (`outputStream`). It first converts the string to a byte array using the `getBytes()` method, and then writes the byte array to the output stream using the `write()` method. 

Note that this method throws an `IOException` if there is an error writing to the output stream, so you may want to handle that exception appropriately in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for an I/O error when writing to the output stream:

```java
public void writeStringToOutputStream(String str, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    byte[] bytes = str.getBytes();
    try {
        outputStream.write(bytes);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // An I/O error occurred, so throw an IOException
        throw new IOException("Error writing to output stream", e);
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur when writing to the output stream. If an I/O error occurs, the method throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while writing to the output stream, and includes the original exception as the cause of the error. 

By doing this, any code that calls this method can handle the `IOException` appropriately, such as by logging the error or displaying an error message to the user.
