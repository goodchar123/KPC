Please write a java method that Set the log level specifying which message levels will be logged by this Handler.
Here's an example Java method that sets the log level for a Handler:

```java
public void setLogLevel(Handler handler, Level level) {
    handler.setLevel(level);
}
```

This method takes in a `Handler` object and a `Level` object as parameters. It then calls the `setLevel()` method on the `Handler` object, passing in the `Level` object as the argument. This sets the log level for the `Handler` to the specified level.

Please check if a security manager exists and if             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control"). for java.util.logging.Handler.setLevel(java.util.logging.Level) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `setLogLevel()` method that checks for the existence of a security manager and the caller's permissions before setting the log level:

```java
public void setLogLevel(Handler handler, Level level) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        // Check if the caller has LoggingPermission("control")
        sm.checkPermission(new LoggingPermission("control", null));
    }
    handler.setLevel(level);
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager exists by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, it then checks if the caller has the `LoggingPermission("control")` permission by calling `SecurityManager.checkPermission()`. If the caller does not have the required permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown. Finally, the method sets the log level for the `Handler` to the specified level.
