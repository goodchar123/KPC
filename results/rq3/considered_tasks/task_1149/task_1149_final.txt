Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested exception handling:

```
public void removeMBeanListener(MBeanServerConnection mbsc, ObjectName mbeanName, NotificationListener listener, NotificationFilter filter, Object handback) throws InstanceNotFoundException, ListenerNotFoundException, IOException {
    try {
        mbsc.removeNotificationListener(mbeanName, listener, filter, handback);
    } catch (InstanceNotFoundException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (ListenerNotFoundException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IOException("A communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server.", e);
    }
}
```

This method now includes exception handling for the following scenarios:

- If the MBean name provided does not match any of the registered MBeans, an `InstanceNotFoundException` is thrown.
- If the listener is not registered in the MBean, or it is not registered with the given filter and handback, a `ListenerNotFoundException` is thrown.
- If a communication problem occurs when talking to the MBean server, an `IOException` is thrown.

In all other cases, any other exceptions thrown by the `removeNotificationListener` method are caught and re-thrown as an `IOException` with a generic error message.
