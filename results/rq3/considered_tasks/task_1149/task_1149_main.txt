Please write a java method that Removes a listener from a registered MBean.The MBean must have a listener that exactly matches the given listener, filter, and handback parameters.
Here's an example Java method that removes a listener from a registered MBean:

```
public void removeMBeanListener(MBeanServerConnection mbsc, ObjectName mbeanName, NotificationListener listener, NotificationFilter filter, Object handback) throws Exception {
    mbsc.removeNotificationListener(mbeanName, listener, filter, handback);
}
```

This method takes in the following parameters:

- `mbsc`: The `MBeanServerConnection` object representing the MBean server where the MBean is registered.
- `mbeanName`: The `ObjectName` of the MBean from which to remove the listener.
- `listener`: The `NotificationListener` object to remove.
- `filter`: The `NotificationFilter` object that was used to register the listener.
- `handback`: The `Object` that was used as the handback object when registering the listener.

The method calls the `removeNotificationListener` method on the `MBeanServerConnection` object, passing in the `mbeanName`, `listener`, `filter`, and `handback` parameters to remove the listener from the MBean. If the listener is not found, an `InstanceNotFoundException` is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check The MBean name provided does not match any of the registered MBeans. for javax.management.MBeanServerConnection.removeNotificationListener(javax.management.ObjectName,javax.management.NotificationListener,javax.management.NotificationFilter,java.lang.Object) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InstanceNotFoundException.
Please check The listener is not registered in the MBean, or it is not registered with the given filter and handback. for javax.management.MBeanServerConnection.removeNotificationListener(javax.management.ObjectName,javax.management.NotificationListener,javax.management.NotificationFilter,java.lang.Object) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ListenerNotFoundException.
Please check A communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server. for javax.management.MBeanServerConnection.removeNotificationListener(javax.management.ObjectName,javax.management.NotificationListener,javax.management.NotificationFilter,java.lang.Object) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested exception handling:

```
public void removeMBeanListener(MBeanServerConnection mbsc, ObjectName mbeanName, NotificationListener listener, NotificationFilter filter, Object handback) throws InstanceNotFoundException, ListenerNotFoundException, IOException {
    try {
        mbsc.removeNotificationListener(mbeanName, listener, filter, handback);
    } catch (InstanceNotFoundException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (ListenerNotFoundException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IOException("A communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server.", e);
    }
}
```

This method now includes exception handling for the following scenarios:

- If the MBean name provided does not match any of the registered MBeans, an `InstanceNotFoundException` is thrown.
- If the listener is not registered in the MBean, or it is not registered with the given filter and handback, a `ListenerNotFoundException` is thrown.
- If a communication problem occurs when talking to the MBean server, an `IOException` is thrown.

In all other cases, any other exceptions thrown by the `removeNotificationListener` method are caught and re-thrown as an `IOException` with a generic error message.
