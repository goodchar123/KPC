Please write a java method that Returns a new native memory segment with given size and resource scope (replacing the scope already associated with this address), and whose base address is this address.
Here's an example Java method that creates a new native memory segment with a given size and resource scope:

```java
import jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment;
import jdk.incubator.foreign.ResourceScope;

public class NativeMemory {
    private MemorySegment segment;
    
    public void createSegment(long size, ResourceScope scope) {
        if (segment != null) {
            segment.close();
        }
        segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(size, scope);
    }
    
    public MemorySegment getSegment() {
        return segment;
    }
}
```

This method creates a new native memory segment using the `MemorySegment.allocateNative()` method, which takes a size and a resource scope as arguments. The `ResourceScope` parameter specifies the scope of the resource associated with the memory segment. The method also replaces any existing memory segment associated with this object's `segment` field.

To use this method, you can create an instance of the `NativeMemory` class and call the `createSegment()` method with the desired size and resource scope:

```java
NativeMemory memory = new NativeMemory();
memory.createSegment(1024, ResourceScope.newSharedScope());
MemorySegment segment = memory.getSegment();
```

This code creates a new `NativeMemory` object, creates a memory segment with a size of 1024 bytes and a shared resource scope, and retrieves the resulting memory segment using the `getSegment()` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if bytesSize <= 0. for jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment.allocateNative(long,jdk.incubator.foreign.ResourceScope) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if scope has been already closed, or if access occurs from a thread other than the thread owning scope. for jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment.allocateNative(long,jdk.incubator.foreign.ResourceScope) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `createSegment()` method that includes the requested checks:

```java
import jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment;
import jdk.incubator.foreign.ResourceScope;

public class NativeMemory {
    private MemorySegment segment;
    
    public void createSegment(long size, ResourceScope scope) {
        if (size <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Size must be greater than zero");
        }
        if (scope.isClosed()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Scope is already closed");
        }
        if (!scope.isOwnerThread()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Access from a thread other than the owning thread");
        }
        if (segment != null) {
            segment.close();
        }
        segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(size, scope);
    }
    
    public MemorySegment getSegment() {
        return segment;
    }
}
```

This version of the method first checks if the `size` parameter is greater than zero, and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is not. It then checks if the `scope` parameter has been closed or if the access occurs from a thread other than the owning thread, and throws an `IllegalStateException` if either of these conditions is true.

These checks help ensure that the `MemorySegment` is created with valid parameters and that the resource scope is in a valid state.
