Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for `NotYetConnectedException`, `ClosedChannelException`, and other `IOExceptions`:

```java
public void shutdownRead(SocketChannel channel) throws IOException {
    if (!channel.isConnected()) {
        throw new NotYetConnectedException();
    }
    if (channel.isClosed()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    try {
        channel.shutdownInput();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error shutting down input", e);
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the channel is connected using the `isConnected()` method. If it's not connected, it throws a `NotYetConnectedException`. It then checks if the channel is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it's closed, it throws a `ClosedChannelException`. 

If an `IOException` occurs while calling `shutdownInput()`, it catches the exception and throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while shutting down the input. The original exception is included as the cause of the new exception.
