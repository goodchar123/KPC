Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the existence of a security manager and its `checkPermission` method before calling `getStackTrace()`:

```
public static void popStackFrames(int numFrames) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("getStackTrace"));
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < numFrames; i++) {
        Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager is installed by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, it then calls its `checkPermission` method with a `RuntimePermission` object that represents the permission to get the stack trace. If the permission is not granted, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the permission is granted, the method proceeds to pop the specified number of stack frames using `getStackTrace()`.
