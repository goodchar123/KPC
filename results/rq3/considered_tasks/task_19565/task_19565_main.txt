Please write a java method that Pop stack frames.
Here's an example Java method that pops stack frames:

```
public static void popStackFrames(int numFrames) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numFrames; i++) {
        Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This method takes an integer parameter `numFrames` which specifies the number of stack frames to pop. It then uses the `getStackTrace()` method of the current thread to retrieve the stack trace and discard the specified number of frames. 

Note that popping stack frames can be dangerous and should only be done in certain situations, such as when handling exceptions or debugging code.

Please check if a security manager exists and its        checkPermission method doesn't allow        getting the stack trace of thread. for java.lang.Thread.getStackTrace() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the existence of a security manager and its `checkPermission` method before calling `getStackTrace()`:

```
public static void popStackFrames(int numFrames) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("getStackTrace"));
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < numFrames; i++) {
        Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager is installed by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, it then calls its `checkPermission` method with a `RuntimePermission` object that represents the permission to get the stack trace. If the permission is not granted, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the permission is granted, the method proceeds to pop the specified number of stack frames using `getStackTrace()`.
