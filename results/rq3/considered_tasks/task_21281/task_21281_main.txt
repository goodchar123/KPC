Please write a java method that Cancels the updates made to the current row in this ResultSet object.
Here's a Java method that cancels the updates made to the current row in a ResultSet object:

```java
public void cancelRowUpdates(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    rs.cancelRowUpdates();
}
```

This method takes a ResultSet object as a parameter and calls the `cancelRowUpdates()` method on it to cancel any updates made to the current row. It throws a SQLException if there is an error while canceling the updates.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error         occurs; this method is called on a closed result set; the result set concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY or if this method is called when the cursor is            on the insert row for java.sql.ResultSet.cancelRowUpdates() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.cancelRowUpdates() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors, closed result set, result set concurrency, and cursor position before canceling the updates made to the current row in a ResultSet object:

```java
public void cancelRowUpdates(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
    if (rs.getConcurrency() == ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY");
    }
    if (rs.isBeforeFirst() || rs.isAfterLast()) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is not on a valid row");
    }
    if (rs.getRow() == 0) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is on the insert row");
    }
    try {
        rs.cancelRowUpdates();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support cancelRowUpdates()");
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the ResultSet object is closed, has CONCUR_READ_ONLY concurrency, or if the cursor is not on a valid row or on the insert row. If any of these conditions are true, it throws a SQLException with an appropriate error message.

If the ResultSet object is valid, it then tries to cancel the updates made to the current row by calling the `cancelRowUpdates()` method on it. If the JDBC driver does not support this method, it throws a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException. If any other SQLException occurs, it is thrown as is.
