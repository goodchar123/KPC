Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for all the mentioned exceptions:

```java
public Preferences getParentNode(Preferences node) throws BackingStoreException {
    Preferences parent = node.parent();
    while (parent != null) {
        try {
            // Check if the parent node has been removed
            parent.nodeExists("");
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Parent node has been removed", e);
        } catch (BackingStoreException e) {
            throw new BackingStoreException("Unable to communicate with backing store", e);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid path name", e);
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Path name is null", e);
        }
        parent = parent.parent();
    }
    return node.parent();
}
```

This method first gets the parent node of the input node using the `parent()` method. It then checks if the parent node or any of its ancestors have been removed by calling the `nodeExists("")` method on each parent node. If the method throws an `IllegalStateException`, it means that the node or an ancestor has been removed, so the method throws a new `IllegalStateException` with an appropriate error message.

If the `nodeExists()` method throws a `BackingStoreException`, it means that there was a failure in the backing store or the method was unable to communicate with it. In this case, the method throws a new `BackingStoreException` with an appropriate error message.

If the `nodeExists()` method throws an `IllegalArgumentException`, it means that the path name is invalid. In this case, the method throws a new `IllegalArgumentException` with an appropriate error message.

If the `nodeExists()` method throws a `NullPointerException`, it means that the path name is null. In this case, the method throws a new `NullPointerException` with an appropriate error message.

If all parent nodes are valid, the method returns the parent node of the input node.
