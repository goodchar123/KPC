Please write a java method that Specifies that this Statement will be closed when all its dependent result sets are closed.
Here's an example Java method that specifies that a statement will be closed when all its dependent result sets are closed:

```java
public void closeStatementWithDependentResultSets(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    stmt.closeOnCompletion();
}
```

The `closeOnCompletion()` method is used to specify that a statement will be closed when all its dependent result sets are closed. This method is available on the `Statement` interface in Java. 

To use this method, simply pass in a `Statement` object as a parameter to the method. The method will then set the `closeOnCompletion` flag on the statement object, which will cause it to be closed automatically when all its dependent result sets are closed. 

Note that this method may throw a `SQLException` if there is an error setting the `closeOnCompletion` flag on the statement object.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.closeOnCompletion() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the statement is closed before calling `closeOnCompletion()`, and throws a `SQLException` if it is:

```java
public void closeStatementWithDependentResultSets(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    if (stmt.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is already closed");
    }
    stmt.closeOnCompletion();
}
```

The `isClosed()` method is used to check if the statement is closed. If it is, the method throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message. If the statement is not closed, the method calls `closeOnCompletion()` to set the flag that specifies that the statement should be closed when all its dependent result sets are closed.

Please check if this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.closeOnCompletion() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for database access errors when calling `isClosed()`, and also checks if the statement is closed before calling `closeOnCompletion()`, and throws a `SQLException` if either of these conditions are true:

```java
public void closeStatementWithDependentResultSets(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    try {
        if (stmt.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Statement is already closed");
        }
        stmt.closeOnCompletion();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error closing statement with dependent result sets", e);
    }
}
```

In this version of the method, we've added a try-catch block around the call to `isClosed()`, so that we can catch any `SQLException` that might occur if there is a database access error. If such an error occurs, we throw a new `SQLException` with an appropriate error message and the original exception as the cause.

We've also kept the check for a closed statement, as in the previous version of the method. If the statement is closed, we throw a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message. If the statement is not closed, we call `closeOnCompletion()` to set the flag that specifies that the statement should be closed when all its dependent result sets are closed.
