Here's an updated version of the `flushBuffer` method that includes the requested check:

```
public void flushBuffer() throws IOException {
    if (outputStream == null) {
        throw new IOException("Output stream is null");
    }
    buffer.flip();
    while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
        try {
            outputStream.write(buffer.get());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing to output stream", e);
        }
    }
    buffer.clear();
}
```

The `write` method now catches any `IOException` that may be thrown and re-throws it as a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. This includes the case where the output stream has been closed.
