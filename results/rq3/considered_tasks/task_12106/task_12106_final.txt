Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks and exceptions:

```java
public static <K, V> void replaceValues(Map<K, V> map, Function<Map.Entry<K, V>, V> function) {
    Iterator<Map.Entry<K, V>> iterator = map.entrySet().iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Map.Entry<K, V> entry = iterator.next();
        try {
            V newValue = function.apply(entry);
            entry.setValue(newValue);
        } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
            throw new NoSuchElementException("No more elements in the iteration");
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Entry has been removed from the backing map");
        } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Put operation is not supported by the backing map");
        } catch (ClassCastException e) {
            throw new ClassCastException("Class of the specified value prevents it from being stored in the backing map");
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Backing map does not permit null values, and the specified value is null");
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some property of this value prevents it from being stored in the backing map");
        }
    }
}
```

This method now checks for various exceptions that may be thrown during the iteration and modification of the map. If any of these exceptions are caught, a new exception is thrown with a descriptive message. This helps to ensure that the method is used correctly and that any errors are caught and handled appropriately.
