Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this LocalTime with the time truncated.
Here's the Java method that returns a copy of the LocalTime with the time truncated:

```java
public LocalTime truncateTime(LocalTime time) {
    return time.truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.DAYS);
}
```

This method takes a LocalTime object as input and returns a new LocalTime object with the time truncated to the nearest day. The `truncatedTo()` method is used to truncate the time to the specified unit, which in this case is `ChronoUnit.DAYS`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if unable to truncate for java.time.LocalTime.truncatedTo(java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Please check if the unit is not supported for java.time.LocalTime.truncatedTo(java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for exceptions:

```java
public LocalTime truncateTime(LocalTime time) {
    try {
        return time.truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.DAYS);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        System.out.println("Unable to truncate time: " + e.getMessage());
        throw e;
    } catch (UnsupportedTemporalTypeException e) {
        System.out.println("Unsupported temporal type: " + e.getMessage());
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This method now includes try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions. If the `truncatedTo()` method is unable to truncate the time, a `DateTimeException` will be thrown. If the specified unit is not supported for truncation, an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` will be thrown. Both exceptions are caught and re-thrown with an error message.
