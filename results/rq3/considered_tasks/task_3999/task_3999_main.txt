Please write a java method that Filter an ignorable whitespace event.
Here's a Java method that filters an ignorable whitespace event:

```java
public void filterIgnorableWhitespace(XMLStreamReader reader) throws XMLStreamException {
    while (reader.hasNext()) {
        int event = reader.next();
        if (event == XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS && reader.isWhiteSpace()) {
            // ignore the whitespace
        } else {
            // do something with the non-whitespace event
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes an `XMLStreamReader` as input and loops through the events until it encounters a non-whitespace event. It checks if the current event is a `CHARACTERS` event and if it is whitespace using the `isWhiteSpace()` method. If it is whitespace, the method ignores it and continues to the next event. If it is a non-whitespace event, the method breaks out of the loop and returns control to the calling code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if there is a fatal error detecting the next state for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader.hasNext() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw XMLStreamException.
Please check if this is called when hasNext() returns false for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if there is an error processing the underlying XML source for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw XMLStreamException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the error handling you requested:

```java
public void filterIgnorableWhitespace(XMLStreamReader reader) throws XMLStreamException, NoSuchElementException {
    while (reader.hasNext()) {
        try {
            int event = reader.next();
            if (event == XMLStreamConstants.CHARACTERS && reader.isWhiteSpace()) {
                // ignore the whitespace
            } else {
                // do something with the non-whitespace event
                break;
            }
        } catch (XMLStreamException e) {
            if (e.getMessage().contains("detecting the next state")) {
                throw new XMLStreamException("Fatal error detecting the next state", e);
            } else if (e.getMessage().contains("processing the underlying XML source")) {
                throw new XMLStreamException("Error processing the underlying XML source", e);
            } else {
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
    if (!reader.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No more events in the stream");
    }
}
```

This updated method includes try-catch blocks to handle potential errors that may occur during the XML parsing process. If a fatal error is detected while detecting the next state, an `XMLStreamException` is thrown with a custom error message. If there is an error processing the underlying XML source, an `XMLStreamException` is thrown with a custom error message. If any other type of `XMLStreamException` is thrown, it is re-thrown to the calling code.

Additionally, the method now checks if there are no more events in the stream after the loop completes. If there are no more events, a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown with a custom error message.

        if (!reader.hasNext()) {
