Please write a java method that Obtains an instance of DayOfWeek from a temporal object.
Sure, here's an example Java method that obtains an instance of DayOfWeek from a temporal object:

```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor;

public class DayOfWeekHelper {
    public static DayOfWeek getDayOfWeek(TemporalAccessor temporal) {
        return DayOfWeek.from(temporal);
    }
}
```

This method takes a `TemporalAccessor` object as a parameter, which is a generic interface for date-time objects that can be queried for any combination of fields. The `DayOfWeek.from()` method is then used to obtain an instance of `DayOfWeek` from the `TemporalAccessor`. 

You can call this method like this:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        DayOfWeek dayOfWeek = DayOfWeekHelper.getDayOfWeek(date);
        System.out.println("Today is " + dayOfWeek);
    }
}
```

This will output something like "Today is MONDAY", depending on the current day of the week.

Please check if unable to convert to a DayOfWeek for java.time.DayOfWeek.from(java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the `TemporalAccessor` can be converted to a `DayOfWeek`. If it cannot be converted, it throws a `DateTimeException`:

```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor;
import java.time.DateTimeException;

public class DayOfWeekHelper {
    public static DayOfWeek getDayOfWeek(TemporalAccessor temporal) {
        try {
            return DayOfWeek.from(temporal);
        } catch (DateTimeException e) {
            throw new DateTimeException("Unable to convert to DayOfWeek", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown if the `TemporalAccessor` cannot be converted to a `DayOfWeek`. If a `DateTimeException` is caught, it is re-thrown with a custom error message.

You can call this method like this:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        DayOfWeek dayOfWeek = DayOfWeekHelper.getDayOfWeek(date);
        System.out.println("Today is " + dayOfWeek);
    }
}
```

This will output something like "Today is MONDAY", depending on the current day of the week. If the `TemporalAccessor` cannot be converted to a `DayOfWeek`, a `DateTimeException` will be thrown with the error message "Unable to convert to DayOfWeek".
