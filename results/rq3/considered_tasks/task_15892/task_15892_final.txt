You're right, it's important to handle any `IOException` that may occur when reading from the input streams. Here's an updated version of the method that checks for `IOException` and throws it if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileComparator {
    public static long findFirstMismatch(File file1, File file2) throws IOException {
        try (InputStream is1 = new FileInputStream(file1);
             InputStream is2 = new FileInputStream(file2)) {
            long pos = 0;
            int b1, b2;
            while ((b1 = is1.read()) != -1 && (b2 = is2.read()) != -1) {
                if (b1 != b2) {
                    return pos;
                }
                pos++;
            }
            if (is1.read() == -1 && is2.read() == -1) {
                return -1L;
            } else {
                throw new IOException("Files have different lengths");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading files", e);
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we catch any `IOException` that may occur when reading from the input streams and re-throw it with a more descriptive message. We also added an additional check to ensure that both files have the same length. If they don't, we throw an `IOException` with an appropriate message.
