You're right, it's important to check if the index is out of range before calling `vector.get(index)` in the `storeVector` method. Here's an updated version of the method that includes the check and throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the index is out of range:

```java
public static void storeVector(double[] array, int offset, Vector<Double> vector) {
    for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++) {
        int index = i + offset;
        if (index < 0 || index >= array.length) {
            throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Index out of range: " + index);
        }
        array[index] = vector.get(i);
    }
}
```

This updated method checks if the index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the array, and throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` with a message indicating the index that is out of range.

You can call this method like before:

```java
Vector<Double> vector = new Vector<Double>();
vector.add(1.0);
vector.add(2.0);
vector.add(3.0);

double[] array = new double[5];
storeVector(array, 1, vector);
```

And if you try to call `storeVector` with an offset that is too large for the array, like this:

```java
double[] array = new double[2];
storeVector(array, 1, vector);
```

You'll get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` with a message indicating the index that is out of range.
