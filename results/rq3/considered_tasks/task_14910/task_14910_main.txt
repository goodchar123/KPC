Please write a java method that If this Spliterator's source is SORTED by a Comparator, returns that Comparator.
Here's the Java method that checks if the Spliterator's source is sorted by a Comparator and returns that Comparator:

```
public static <T> Comparator<? super T> getComparatorIfSorted(Spliterator<T> spliterator) {
    Comparator<? super T> comparator = spliterator.getComparator();
    if (comparator != null && spliterator.hasCharacteristics(Spliterator.SORTED)) {
        return comparator;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

This method takes a Spliterator as input and returns a Comparator if the Spliterator's source is sorted by a Comparator, otherwise it returns null. 

The method first checks if the Spliterator has a Comparator by calling the `getComparator()` method. If the Spliterator has a Comparator, it then checks if the Spliterator has the `SORTED` characteristic by calling the `hasCharacteristics()` method. If both conditions are true, the method returns the Comparator. Otherwise, it returns null.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the spliterator does not report         a characteristic of SORTED. for java.util.Spliterator.getComparator() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the Spliterator's source is sorted by a Comparator and throws an IllegalStateException if the Spliterator does not report a characteristic of SORTED:

```
public static <T> Comparator<? super T> getComparatorIfSorted(Spliterator<T> spliterator) {
    Comparator<? super T> comparator = spliterator.getComparator();
    if (comparator != null && spliterator.hasCharacteristics(Spliterator.SORTED)) {
        return comparator;
    } else if (comparator == null && !spliterator.hasCharacteristics(Spliterator.SORTED)) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Spliterator is not sorted");
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

If the Spliterator has a Comparator, it then checks if the Spliterator has the `SORTED` characteristic by calling the `hasCharacteristics()` method.

If the Spliterator does not have a Comparator and does not report a characteristic of SORTED, the method throws an IllegalStateException with the message "Spliterator is not sorted". Otherwise, it returns null.
