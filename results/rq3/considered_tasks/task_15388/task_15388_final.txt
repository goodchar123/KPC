Sure, here's an updated version of the code that checks if the value of any field is out of range or if the day of month is invalid for the month year for `LocalDate.of(int, int, int)`, and throws a `DateTimeException` if any of these conditions are met:

```java
LocalDate date = null;
try {
    date = LocalDate.of(2021, 2, 29);
} catch (DateTimeException e) {
    throw new DateTimeException("Invalid date value: " + e.getMessage(), e);
}

System.out.println(date); // prints "2021-02-28"
```

This updated code tries to create a `LocalDate` object representing February 29th, 2021, and throws a `DateTimeException` if the value is out of range or if the day of month is invalid for the month year. If no exception is thrown, it prints the resulting date, which in this case is "2021-02-28" since February 2021 only has 28 days.
