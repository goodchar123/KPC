This updated code snippet includes error handling for the following scenarios:
- The requested MIDI device is not available due to resource restrictions
- The info object does not represent a MIDI device installed on the system
- The info object is null
- The device cannot be opened due to resource restrictions
- The device cannot be opened due to security restrictions
- The sequencer is not available due to resource restrictions, or there is no Receiver available by any installed MidiDevice, or no sequencer is installed in the system
- The sequence contains invalid MIDI data, or is not supported
- The status byte or all data bytes belonging to the message do not specify a valid MIDI message
- The track is not part of the current sequence
- The sequencer is closed
- The value of millis is negative
- The Sequencer is closed when stopping playback.
