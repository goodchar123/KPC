Please write a java method that Delete a cell from the current row.
Assuming you are working with a Java `ResultSet` object, you can use the `deleteRow()` method to delete the current row. Here's an example method:

```java
public void deleteCurrentRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    rs.deleteRow();
}
```

You can call this method with a `ResultSet` object to delete the current row. Note that this method will throw a `SQLException` if the `ResultSet` is not updatable or if the cursor is not positioned on a valid row.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs; the result set concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY; this method is called on a closed result set or if this method is called when the cursor is on the insert row for java.sql.ResultSet.deleteRow() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.deleteRow() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `deleteCurrentRow()` method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public void deleteCurrentRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
    if (rs.getConcurrency() == ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY");
    }
    if (rs.isBeforeFirst() || rs.isAfterLast()) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is not positioned on a valid row");
    }
    if (rs.isInsertRow()) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is on the insert row");
    }
    if (!rs.getMetaData().supportsResultSetConcurrency(ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE)) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support updatable result sets");
    }
    rs.deleteRow();
}
```

This version of the method checks for the various error conditions you specified and throws the appropriate exceptions if any of them are encountered.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.getConcurrency() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is         called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.isBeforeFirst() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.isBeforeFirst() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is         called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.isAfterLast() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.isAfterLast() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is         called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.getMetaData() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs; the result set concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY; this method is called on a closed result set or if this method is called when the cursor is on the insert row for java.sql.ResultSet.deleteRow() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.deleteRow() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `deleteCurrentRow()` method that includes all the error checking you requested:

```java
public void deleteCurrentRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
    int concurrency;
    try {
        concurrency = rs.getConcurrency();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error getting result set concurrency", e);
    }
    if (concurrency == ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY");
    }
    boolean beforeFirst;
    try {
        beforeFirst = rs.isBeforeFirst();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error checking if cursor is before first row", e);
    }
    if (beforeFirst) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is before first row");
    }
    boolean afterLast;
    try {
        afterLast = rs.isAfterLast();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error checking if cursor is after last row", e);
    }
    if (afterLast) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is after last row");
    }
    if (rs.isInsertRow()) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is on the insert row");
    }
    DatabaseMetaData metaData;
    try {
        metaData = rs.getMetaData();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error getting result set metadata", e);
    }
    if (!metaData.supportsResultSetConcurrency(ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE)) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support updatable result sets");
    }
    rs.deleteRow();
}
```

This version of the method checks for all the error conditions you specified and throws the appropriate exceptions if any of them are encountered. Note that for some of the checks, we need to catch a `SQLException` and re-throw it with a more informative message.

Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.isBeforeFirst() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.isAfterLast() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.deleteRow() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `deleteCurrentRow()` method that includes the additional checks for unsupported methods:

```java
public void deleteCurrentRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
    int concurrency;
    try {
        concurrency = rs.getConcurrency();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error getting result set concurrency", e);
    }
    if (concurrency == ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY");
    }
    boolean beforeFirst;
    try {
        beforeFirst = rs.isBeforeFirst();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0 && e.getSQLState().equals("S1009")) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support isBeforeFirst()");
        } else {
            throw new SQLException("Error checking if cursor is before first row", e);
        }
    }
    if (beforeFirst) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is before first row");
    }
    boolean afterLast;
    try {
        afterLast = rs.isAfterLast();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0 && e.getSQLState().equals("S1009")) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support isAfterLast()");
        } else {
            throw new SQLException("Error checking if cursor is after last row", e);
        }
    }
    if (afterLast) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is after last row");
    }
    if (rs.isInsertRow()) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is on the insert row");
    }
    DatabaseMetaData metaData;
    try {
        metaData = rs.getMetaData();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error getting result set metadata", e);
    }
    if (!metaData.supportsResultSetConcurrency(ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE)) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support updatable result sets");
    }
    try {
        rs.deleteRow();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0 && e.getSQLState().equals("S1009")) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support deleteRow()");
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method checks for unsupported methods and throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` if any of them are encountered. Note that we need to catch the `SQLException` thrown by the unsupported method and check its error code and SQL state to determine if it's an unsupported method exception.
