Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the value is 0 or negative before setting the receive buffer size for the ServerSocket:

```
public void setDefaultReceiveBufferSize(ServerSocket serverSocket, int size) throws SocketException, IllegalArgumentException {
    if (size <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Buffer size must be greater than 0");
    }
    serverSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(size);
}
```

This method first checks if the buffer size is less than or equal to 0. If it is, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a message indicating that the buffer size must be greater than 0. If the buffer size is valid, the method calls the `setReceiveBufferSize()` method on the ServerSocket object, passing in the buffer size as the argument. This sets the default proposed value for the SO_RCVBUF option for sockets accepted from the ServerSocket. If there is an error setting the buffer size, a SocketException is thrown.
