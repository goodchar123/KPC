You are correct. It is important to validate the input value for the second-of-minute to ensure that it is within the valid range of 0 to 59. Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes input validation and throws a DateTimeException if the second value is invalid:

```java
public static LocalTime withSecondOfMinute(LocalTime time, int second) {
    if (second < 0 || second > 59) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid value for second-of-minute: " + second);
    }
    return time.withSecond(second);
}
```

This updated method first checks if the input value for the second-of-minute is within the valid range of 0 to 59. If the value is invalid, it throws a DateTimeException with a message indicating the invalid value. If the value is valid, it returns a copy of the LocalTime object with the second-of-minute altered to the specified value using the `withSecond()` method.
