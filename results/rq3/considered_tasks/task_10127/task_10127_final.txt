You're right, it's important to add those checks to ensure the method is robust. Here's the updated code with the checks:

```java
public static byte[] readBytes(InputStream inputStream, int len) throws IOException {
    if (inputStream == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("InputStream cannot be null");
    }
    if (len < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Length cannot be negative");
    }
    byte[] buffer = new byte[len];
    int bytesRead = 0;
    while (bytesRead < len) {
        int count = inputStream.read(buffer, bytesRead, len - bytesRead);
        if (count == -1) {
            throw new EOFException("End of stream reached before all bytes could be read");
        }
        bytesRead += count;
    }
    return buffer;
}
```

Now, if the `inputStream` parameter is `null`, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown. Similarly, if `len` is negative, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown. Additionally, if `off` is negative, `len` is negative, or `len` is greater than `b.length - off`, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown by the `read()` method of the input stream.
