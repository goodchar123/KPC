Please write a java method that Sets the port number on the remote host to which this datagram is being sent.
Here's a Java method that sets the port number on the remote host to which a datagram is being sent:

```java
public void setPort(DatagramPacket packet, int port) {
    packet.setPort(port);
}
```

This method takes in a `DatagramPacket` object and an integer `port` as parameters. It then calls the `setPort()` method on the `DatagramPacket` object, passing in the `port` parameter to set the port number on the remote host to which the datagram is being sent.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the port is out of range for java.net.DatagramPacket.setPort(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the port is out of range for `java.net.DatagramPacket.setPort(int)` and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is:

```java
public void setPort(DatagramPacket packet, int port) {
    if (port < 0 || port > 65535) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Port number out of range: " + port);
    }
    packet.setPort(port);
}
```

This method first checks if the `port` parameter is less than 0 or greater than 65535, which are the valid port numbers. If the port is out of range, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating the invalid port number. If the port is within range, it calls the `setPort()` method on the `DatagramPacket` object, passing in the `port` parameter to set the port number on the remote host to which the datagram is being sent.
