Sure, here's an updated version of the `addTimerNotification` method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```java
public void addTimerNotification(Date date, String type, String message, Object userData) {
    TimerNotification notification = new TimerNotification(type, message, userData, date, null, 0);
    try {
        notifications.add(notification);
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        System.err.println("Add operation is not supported by this list.");
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        System.err.println("Class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this list.");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        System.err.println("Specified element is null and this list does not permit null elements.");
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        System.err.println("Some property of this element prevents it from being added to this list.");
    }
}
```

In this version, the `add` method is called within a try-catch block that catches the four exceptions you mentioned. If any of these exceptions are thrown, an error message is printed to the console.
