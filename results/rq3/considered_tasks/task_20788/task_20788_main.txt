Please write a java method that Returns a value indicating whether this Statement will be closed when all its dependent result sets are closed.
Here's a Java method that returns a boolean value indicating whether a Statement will be closed when all its dependent result sets are closed:

```java
public boolean isCloseOnCompletion(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    return stmt.isCloseOnCompletion();
}
```

This method takes a Statement object as a parameter and calls its `isCloseOnCompletion()` method to determine whether the Statement will be closed when all its dependent result sets are closed. The method returns a boolean value indicating the result. If the Statement is set to be closed on completion, the method will return `true`; otherwise, it will return `false`. 

Note that this method may throw a `SQLException` if there is an error accessing the database or if the Statement has been closed. You may need to handle this exception in your code.

Please check if this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.isCloseOnCompletion() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the Statement is closed before calling `isCloseOnCompletion()`, and throws a `SQLException` if it is:

```java
public boolean isCloseOnCompletion(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    if (stmt.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed");
    }
    return stmt.isCloseOnCompletion();
}
```

This method first checks if the Statement is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message. If the Statement is not closed, it calls the `isCloseOnCompletion()` method and returns its result.

Note that this method still may throw a `SQLException` if there is an error accessing the database. You may need to handle this exception in your code as well.

Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.Statement.isClosed() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.isCloseOnCompletion() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for both database access errors and closed Statements:

```java
public boolean isCloseOnCompletion(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    try {
        if (stmt.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Statement is closed");
        }
        return stmt.isCloseOnCompletion();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error accessing database: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method first tries to call `isClosed()` on the Statement object. If the Statement is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message. If the Statement is not closed, it calls `isCloseOnCompletion()` and returns its result.

If a database access error occurs while calling either method, the method catches the `SQLException` and throws a new `SQLException` with an error message that includes the original exception's message.

Note that this method still may throw a `SQLException` if there is an error accessing the database. You may need to handle this exception in your code as well.
