
I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here's an updated version of the method that checks if the Statement is closed before calling `isCloseOnCompletion()`, and throws a `SQLException` if it is:

```java
public boolean isCloseOnCompletion(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    if (stmt.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed");
    }
    return stmt.isCloseOnCompletion();
}
```

This method first checks if the Statement is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message. If the Statement is not closed, it calls the `isCloseOnCompletion()` method and returns its result.

Note that this method still may throw a `SQLException` if there is an error accessing the database. You may need to handle this exception in your code as well.
