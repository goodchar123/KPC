Please write a java method that Sets this Timestamp object's nanos field to the given value.
Here's a Java method that sets the nanos field of a Timestamp object:

```java
public static void setNanos(Timestamp timestamp, int nanos) {
    timestamp.setNanos(nanos);
}
```

This method takes a Timestamp object and an integer value for the nanoseconds. It then calls the `setNanos()` method on the Timestamp object, passing in the nanoseconds value to set the nanos field of the Timestamp object to the given value.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the given argument         is greater than 999999999 or less than 0 for java.sql.Timestamp.setNanos(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `setNanos()` method that checks if the given argument is greater than 999999999 or less than 0, and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is:

```java
public static void setNanos(Timestamp timestamp, int nanos) {
    if (nanos < 0 || nanos > 999999999) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Nanoseconds value must be between 0 and 999999999");
    }
    timestamp.setNanos(nanos);
}
```

This method first checks if the given `nanos` value is less than 0 or greater than 999999999. If it is, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the nanoseconds value must be between 0 and 999999999. If the `nanos` value is within the valid range, it calls the `setNanos()` method on the `Timestamp` object to set its nanoseconds field to the given value.
