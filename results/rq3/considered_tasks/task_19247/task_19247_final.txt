Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a closed channel and throws a `ClosedChannelException` if necessary, and also checks for an I/O error and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.SocketAddress;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel;

public static SocketAddress[] getRemoteAddresses(SocketChannel channel) throws IOException {
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    try {
        return channel.getRemoteAddress();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the channel is open using the `isOpen()` method. If the channel is closed, it throws a `ClosedChannelException`. If the channel is open, it tries to get the remote address using `getRemoteAddress()`. If an I/O error occurs, it throws an `IOException`. If no exceptions occur, it returns an array of `SocketAddress` objects representing all of the remote addresses to which the channel's socket is connected.
