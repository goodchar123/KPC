Please write a java method that Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result.
Here is an example of a Java method that waits for a computation to complete and retrieves its result:

```
public static <T> T getResult(Future<T> future) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
    T result = future.get(); // waits for the computation to complete and retrieves the result
    return result;
}
```

This method takes a `Future` object as its parameter, which represents a computation that may not have completed yet. The `get()` method of the `Future` object blocks until the computation is complete and returns the result.

If the computation is interrupted or encounters an exception, the `get()` method will throw an `InterruptedException` or an `ExecutionException`, respectively. Therefore, the `getResult()` method also declares these exceptions in its signature.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the computation was cancelled for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw CancellationException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `getResult()` method that checks if the computation was cancelled and throws a `CancellationException` if it was:

```
public static <T> T getResult(Future<T> future) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, CancellationException {
    T result = future.get(); // waits for the computation to complete and retrieves the result
    if (future.isCancelled()) {
        throw new CancellationException("Computation was cancelled");
    }
    return result;
}
```

This version of the method first calls `future.get()` to wait for the computation to complete and retrieve the result. Then it checks if the computation was cancelled by calling `future.isCancelled()`. If it was, it throws a `CancellationException` with an appropriate message.

Note that the `CancellationException` is a checked exception, so it needs to be declared in the method signature along with `InterruptedException` and `ExecutionException`.

Please check if the computation threw an exception for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ExecutionException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `getResult()` method that checks if the computation was cancelled or threw an exception, and throws the appropriate exception if it did:

```
public static <T> T getResult(Future<T> future) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, CancellationException {
    T result;
    try {
        result = future.get(); // waits for the computation to complete and retrieves the result
    } catch (CancellationException e) {
        throw e; // rethrow the cancellation exception
    } catch (ExecutionException e) {
        Throwable cause = e.getCause();
        if (cause instanceof RuntimeException) {
            throw (RuntimeException) cause; // rethrow the runtime exception
        } else if (cause instanceof Error) {
            throw (Error) cause; // rethrow the error
        } else {
            throw e; // rethrow the execution exception
        }
    }
    if (future.isCancelled()) {
        throw new CancellationException("Computation was cancelled");
    }
    return result;
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may be thrown by the `future.get()` method. If a `CancellationException` is caught, it is rethrown immediately. If an `ExecutionException` is caught, the method checks the cause of the exception to see if it was a `RuntimeException` or an `Error`. If it was, the method rethrows that exception. Otherwise, it rethrows the `ExecutionException`.

After the try-catch block, the method checks if the computation was cancelled by calling `future.isCancelled()`. If it was, it throws a `CancellationException` with an appropriate message. Otherwise, it returns the result.
