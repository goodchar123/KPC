List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
The Java JDK methods used in the method above are:

1. `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()` - This method waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result.
2. `java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException` - This exception is thrown when an error occurs during the execution of the computation.
3. `java.lang.InterruptedException` - This exception is thrown when a thread is interrupted while waiting for the computation to complete.

 + From response, we get: ['java.util.concurrent.Future.get()', 'java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException', 'java.lang.InterruptedException']

Is the CancellationException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ExecutionException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `ExecutionException` is declared in the method signature and can be thrown by the `get()` method, so it is being handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the InterruptedException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `InterruptedException` is declared in the method signature and can be thrown by the `get()` method, so it is being handled or caught in the code snippet.

1. `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()`
2. `java.util.concurrent.Future.isCancelled()`
3. `java.util.concurrent.CancellationException.CancellationException(String)`

 + From response, we get: ['java.util.concurrent.Future.get()', 'java.util.concurrent.Future.isCancelled()', 'java.util.concurrent.CancellationException.CancellationException(String)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the CancellationException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `CancellationException` is not handled or caught for `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()` in the code snippet. It is only thrown if the computation was cancelled, but it is not caught or handled within the `getResult()` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ExecutionException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `ExecutionException` is not handled or caught for `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()` in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature and can be thrown if the computation throws an exception, but it is not caught or handled within the `getResult()` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the InterruptedException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `InterruptedException` is handled or caught for `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()` in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature and can be thrown if the thread waiting for the computation to complete is interrupted. In the `getResult()` method, it is caught and re-thrown to the caller.

 + From response, we get: ['java.util.concurrent.Future.get()', 'java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException.getCause()', 'java.util.concurrent.Future.isCancelled()', 'java.util.concurrent.CancellationException(Stringmessage)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the CancellationException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `CancellationException` is handled and rethrown in the `getResult()` method for the `future.get()` method call.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ExecutionException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `ExecutionException` is handled and processed in the `getResult()` method for the `future.get()` method call.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the InterruptedException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `InterruptedException` is handled and declared to be thrown in the `getResult()` method for the `future.get()` method call.
