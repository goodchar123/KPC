Please write a java method that Prevents this application from being suddenly terminated.
One way to prevent a Java application from being suddenly terminated is to use a shutdown hook. A shutdown hook is a thread that is registered with the JVM and is executed when the JVM is about to shut down. Here's an example of how to create a shutdown hook in Java:

```java
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Register a shutdown hook
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
            // Perform cleanup tasks here
            System.out.println("Shutting down...");
        }));

        // Your application code here
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new thread using a lambda expression and register it as a shutdown hook using the `addShutdownHook` method of the `Runtime` class. The lambda expression contains the code that should be executed when the JVM is about to shut down. In this case, we simply print a message to the console.

When the JVM is about to shut down, it will execute all registered shutdown hooks in the order in which they were registered. This gives your application a chance to perform any necessary cleanup tasks before exiting.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If the specified hook has already been registered,          or if it can be determined that the hook is already running or          has already been run for java.lang.Runtime.addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check If the virtual machine is already in the process          of shutting down for java.lang.Runtime.addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check If a security manager is present and it denies          RuntimePermission("shutdownHooks") for java.lang.Runtime.addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Register a shutdown hook
        Thread shutdownHook = new Thread(() -> {
            // Perform cleanup tasks here
            System.out.println("Shutting down...");
        });

        try {
            // Check if the hook has already been registered
            if (!Runtime.getRuntime().removeShutdownHook(shutdownHook)) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Shutdown hook not registered");
            }

            // Register the hook
            Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(shutdownHook);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException | IllegalStateException e) {
            System.err.println("Error registering shutdown hook: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.err.println("Cannot register shutdown hook due to security restrictions");
        }

        // Your application code here
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first create the shutdown hook thread as before. We then attempt to remove the hook using the `removeShutdownHook` method of the `Runtime` class. If the hook has already been registered, this method will return `true` and the hook will be removed. If the hook has not been registered, this method will return `false` and we throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

Next, we attempt to register the hook using the `addShutdownHook` method. If the virtual machine is already in the process of shutting down, this method will throw an `IllegalStateException`. If a security manager is present and denies the `RuntimePermission("shutdownHooks")`, this method will throw a `SecurityException`.

Finally, we catch any exceptions that may be thrown during the registration process and print an error message to the console.
