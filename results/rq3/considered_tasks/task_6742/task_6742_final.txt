Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for exceptions and throws them if necessary:

```java
public static int getFieldFromInstant(Instant instant, ChronoField field) {
    try {
        return instant.get(field);
    } catch (DateTimeException | UnsupportedTemporalTypeException | ArithmeticException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This method now includes a try-catch block that catches any of the three exceptions that can be thrown by the `Instant.get(TemporalField)` method. If any of these exceptions are caught, they are re-thrown to the calling method.

This ensures that any issues with obtaining the field value from the `Instant` object are properly handled and reported to the caller.
