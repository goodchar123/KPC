List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
The `hasInsertion` method uses the following fully qualified Java JDK methods:

1. `java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted()` - This method is used to determine whether the current row in the ResultSet object has had an insertion.

2. `java.sql.SQLException` - This exception is thrown when an error occurs while accessing a database or executing a SQL statement.

So the list of fully qualified Java JDK methods used in the `hasInsertion` method is:

- `java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted()`
- `java.sql.SQLException`

 + From response, we get: ['hasInsertion', 'java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted()', 'java.sql.SQLException', 'hasInsertion', 'java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted()', 'java.sql.SQLException']

Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SQLException` is not handled or caught in the `hasInsertion` method. It is simply declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword, which means that any `SQLException` that occurs during the execution of the method will be propagated up the call stack to the calling method to be handled or caught there.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLFeatureNotSupportedException handled or caught for java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is not handled or caught in the `hasInsertion` method. If a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown during the execution of the `rowInserted()` method, it will be propagated up the call stack to the calling method to be handled or caught there.
