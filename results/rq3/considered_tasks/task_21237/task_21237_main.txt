Please write a java method that Retrieves whether the current row has had an insertion.
Assuming you are working with a JDBC ResultSet object, you can use the `rowInserted()` method to determine whether the current row has had an insertion. Here's an example method:

```java
public boolean hasInsertion(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    return rs.rowInserted();
}
```

This method takes a ResultSet object as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the current row has had an insertion. If the current row has had an insertion, the method will return `true`. Otherwise, it will return `false`.

Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.rowInserted() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the exception handling you requested:

```java
public boolean hasInsertion(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
    if (!rs.getMetaData().supportsResultSetType(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE)) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE");
    }
    try {
        return rs.rowInserted();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the ResultSet is closed and throws a SQLException if it is. It then checks if the JDBC driver supports the `TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE` ResultSet type, which is required for the `rowInserted()` method to work. If the driver does not support this type, a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown.

Finally, the method attempts to call the `rowInserted()` method and catches any SQLException that may occur. If a database access error occurs, the method throws a new SQLException with the original exception as the cause.
