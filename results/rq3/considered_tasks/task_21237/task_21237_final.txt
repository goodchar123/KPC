
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the exception handling you requested:

```java
public boolean hasInsertion(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
    if (!rs.getMetaData().supportsResultSetType(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE)) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE");
    }
    try {
        return rs.rowInserted();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the ResultSet is closed and throws a SQLException if it is. It then checks if the JDBC driver supports the `TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE` ResultSet type, which is required for the `rowInserted()` method to work. If the driver does not support this type, a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown.

Finally, the method attempts to call the `rowInserted()` method and catches any SQLException that may occur. If a database access error occurs, the method throws a new SQLException with the original exception as the cause.
