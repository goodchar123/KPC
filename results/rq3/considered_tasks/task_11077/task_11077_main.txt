Please write a java method that Retrieves a server socket associated with this channel.
Here's a Java method that retrieves a server socket associated with a channel:

```java
public ServerSocketChannel getServerSocketChannel(SocketChannel channel) throws IOException {
    ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = channel.socket().getServerSocketChannel();
    if (serverSocketChannel == null) {
        throw new IOException("Channel is not associated with a server socket");
    }
    return serverSocketChannel;
}
```

This method takes a `SocketChannel` as input and returns the associated `ServerSocketChannel`. It first retrieves the `ServerSocketChannel` using the `getServerSocketChannel()` method of the `Socket` object associated with the channel. If the `ServerSocketChannel` is `null`, it throws an `IOException` indicating that the channel is not associated with a server socket. Otherwise, it returns the `ServerSocketChannel`.

Please check If the channel's socket is not an Internet protocol socket for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.socket() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that retrieves a server socket associated with a channel and checks if the channel's socket is an Internet protocol socket:

```java
public ServerSocketChannel getServerSocketChannel(SocketChannel channel) throws IOException {
    Socket socket = channel.socket();
    if (!(socket instanceof InetSocketAddress)) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Channel's socket is not an Internet protocol socket");
    }
    ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = ((InetSocketAddress) socket).getServerSocketChannel();
    if (serverSocketChannel == null) {
        throw new IOException("Channel is not associated with a server socket");
    }
    return serverSocketChannel;
}
```

This method first retrieves the `Socket` object associated with the channel. It then checks if the socket is an instance of `InetSocketAddress`, which indicates that it is an Internet protocol socket. If it is not, it throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` indicating that the channel's socket is not an Internet protocol socket.

If the socket is an Internet protocol socket, the method retrieves the `ServerSocketChannel` using the `getServerSocketChannel()` method of the `InetSocketAddress` object. If the `ServerSocketChannel` is `null`, it throws an `IOException` indicating that the channel is not associated with a server socket. Otherwise, it returns the `ServerSocketChannel`.
