Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this OffsetTime with the hour-of-day altered.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of an OffsetTime object with the hour-of-day altered:

```java
public OffsetTime changeHour(OffsetTime offsetTime, int hour) {
    return offsetTime.withHour(hour);
}
```

This method takes an OffsetTime object and an integer value for the new hour-of-day. It returns a copy of the original OffsetTime object with the hour-of-day altered to the new value. The `withHour()` method is used to modify the hour-of-day field of the OffsetTime object.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the hour value is invalid for java.time.OffsetTime.withHour(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the hour value is valid and throws a `DateTimeException` if it's not:

```java
public OffsetTime changeHour(OffsetTime offsetTime, int hour) {
    try {
        return offsetTime.withHour(hour);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid hour value: " + hour, e);
    }
}
```

This method takes an OffsetTime object and an integer value for the new hour-of-day. It first tries to modify the hour-of-day field of the OffsetTime object using the `withHour()` method. If the hour value is invalid, a `DateTimeException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the invalid hour value. The original exception is passed as a cause of the new exception for debugging purposes.
