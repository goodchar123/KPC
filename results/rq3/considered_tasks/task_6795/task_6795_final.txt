Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the hour value is valid and throws a `DateTimeException` if it's not:

```java
public OffsetTime changeHour(OffsetTime offsetTime, int hour) {
    try {
        return offsetTime.withHour(hour);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid hour value: " + hour, e);
    }
}
```

This method takes an OffsetTime object and an integer value for the new hour-of-day. It first tries to modify the hour-of-day field of the OffsetTime object using the `withHour()` method. If the hour value is invalid, a `DateTimeException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the invalid hour value. The original exception is passed as a cause of the new exception for debugging purposes.
