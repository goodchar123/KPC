Please write a java method that Shutdown the connection for reading without closing the channel.
Here's a Java method that shuts down the connection for reading without closing the channel:

```java
public void shutdownRead(SocketChannel channel) throws IOException {
    channel.shutdownInput();
}
```

This method takes a `SocketChannel` as a parameter and calls its `shutdownInput()` method to shut down the connection for reading. This will cause any further attempts to read from the channel to result in an `IOException`. However, the channel itself remains open and can still be used for writing or other operations.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If this channel is not yet connected for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.shutdownInput() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NotYetConnectedException.
Please check If this channel is closed for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.shutdownInput() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ClosedChannelException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for `NotYetConnectedException` and `ClosedChannelException`:

```java
public void shutdownRead(SocketChannel channel) throws IOException {
    if (!channel.isConnected()) {
        throw new NotYetConnectedException();
    }
    if (channel.isClosed()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    channel.shutdownInput();
}
```

This method first checks if the channel is connected using the `isConnected()` method. If it's not connected, it throws a `NotYetConnectedException`. It then checks if the channel is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it's closed, it throws a `ClosedChannelException`. If neither of these exceptions are thrown, it calls `shutdownInput()` to shut down the connection for reading.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If this channel is not yet connected for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.shutdownInput() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NotYetConnectedException.
Please check If this channel is closed for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.shutdownInput() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ClosedChannelException.
Please check If some other I/O error occurs for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.shutdownInput() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for `NotYetConnectedException`, `ClosedChannelException`, and other `IOExceptions`:

    }
    if (channel.isClosed()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    try {
        channel.shutdownInput();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error shutting down input", e);
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the channel is connected using the `isConnected()` method. If it's not connected, it throws a `NotYetConnectedException`. It then checks if the channel is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it's closed, it throws a `ClosedChannelException`. If neither of these exceptions are thrown, it calls `shutdownInput()` to shut down the connection for reading. If an `IOException` occurs during the call to `shutdownInput()`, it throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating the error.
