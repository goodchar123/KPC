Please write a java method that Sends a MIDI message and time-stamp to this receiver.
Sure, here's an example Java method that sends a MIDI message and time-stamp to a receiver:

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public class MidiSender {
    public static void sendMidiMessage(Receiver receiver, MidiMessage message, long timeStamp) {
        receiver.send(message, timeStamp);
    }
}
```

This method takes in a `Receiver` object, a `MidiMessage` object, and a `long` time-stamp as parameters. It then calls the `send()` method on the `Receiver` object, passing in the `MidiMessage` and time-stamp as arguments.

You can use this method to send MIDI messages to a MIDI device or software synthesizer. For example:

```java
// Create a new MidiDevice and open it
MidiDevice device = MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(deviceInfo);
device.open();

// Get the Receiver from the MidiDevice
Receiver receiver = device.getReceiver();

// Create a new ShortMessage to send
ShortMessage message = new ShortMessage();
message.setMessage(ShortMessage.NOTE_ON, 0, 60, 127);

// Send the message with a time-stamp of 0
MidiSender.sendMidiMessage(receiver, message, 0);

// Close the MidiDevice and Receiver when finished
receiver.close();
device.close();
``` 

In this example, we first create a `MidiDevice` object and open it. We then get the `Receiver` from the `MidiDevice` and create a new `ShortMessage` to send. Finally, we call the `sendMidiMessage()` method with the `Receiver`, `ShortMessage`, and a time-stamp of 0 to send the message immediately. We then close the `Receiver` and `MidiDevice` when finished.

Please check if the receiver is closed for javax.sound.midi.Receiver.send(javax.sound.midi.MidiMessage,long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if the requested device is not available         due to resource restrictions for javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.Info) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw MidiUnavailableException.
Please check if the info object does not represent a         MIDI device installed on the system for javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.Info) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if info is null for javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.Info) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check thrown if the device cannot be opened         due to resource restrictions for javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.open() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw MidiUnavailableException.
Please check thrown if the device cannot be opened due to         security restrictions for javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.open() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check thrown if a receiver is not available         due to resource restrictions for javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.getReceiver() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw MidiUnavailableException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes the requested error checking:

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public class MidiSender {
    public static void sendMidiMessage(Receiver receiver, MidiMessage message, long timeStamp) throws IllegalStateException {
        if (receiver == null || receiver.isClosed()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Receiver is closed");
        }
        receiver.send(message, timeStamp);
    }
}

public class MidiDeviceManager {
    public static MidiDevice getMidiDevice(MidiDevice.Info info) throws MidiUnavailableException, IllegalArgumentException, NullPointerException {
        if (info == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("MidiDevice.Info is null");
        }
        if (!MidiSystem.isMidiDevice(info)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("MidiDevice.Info does not represent a MIDI device installed on the system");
        }
        MidiDevice device = MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(info);
        if (!device.isOpen()) {
            try {
                device.open();
            } catch (MidiUnavailableException e) {
                throw new MidiUnavailableException("Device cannot be opened due to resource restrictions");
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Device cannot be opened due to security restrictions");
            }
        }
        return device;
    }
    
    public static Receiver getReceiver(MidiDevice device) throws MidiUnavailableException {
        Receiver receiver = device.getReceiver();
        if (receiver == null) {
            throw new MidiUnavailableException("Receiver is not available due to resource restrictions");
        }
        return receiver;
    }
}
```

In the `sendMidiMessage()` method, we first check if the `Receiver` object is null or closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it is, we throw an `IllegalStateException` with an appropriate error message.

In the `getMidiDevice()` method, we first check if the `MidiDevice.Info` object is null using a `NullPointerException`. We then check if it represents a MIDI device installed on the system using the `isMidiDevice()` method. If it doesn't, we throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with an appropriate error message.

We then get the `MidiDevice` object using the `getMidiDevice()` method and check if it is open. If it isn't, we try to open it and catch any `MidiUnavailableException` or `SecurityException` that may be thrown. If the device cannot be opened due to resource restrictions, we throw a `MidiUnavailableException` with an appropriate error message. If it cannot be opened due to security restrictions, we throw a `SecurityException` with an appropriate error message.

In the `getReceiver()` method, we get the `Receiver` object from the `MidiDevice` and check if it is null using a `MidiUnavailableException`. If it is, we throw a `MidiUnavailableException` with an appropriate error message.
