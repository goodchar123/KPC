Please write a java method that Causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled or interrupted, or the specified deadline elapses.
Here is an example of a Java method that causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled or interrupted, or the specified deadline elapses:

```
public void waitForSignal(long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
    synchronized(this) {
        this.wait(timeout);
    }
}
```

This method takes a `long` parameter `timeout` which specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for a signal before returning. The method uses the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that only one thread can wait on this object at a time. The `wait` method is then called on the object, which causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled or interrupted, or the specified deadline elapses. If the thread is interrupted while waiting, an `InterruptedException` is thrown.

Please check if the current thread is not               the owner of this object's monitor. for java.lang.Object.notify() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks if the current thread is the owner of the object's monitor before calling `notify()`, and throws an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if it is not:

```
public void signal() {
    synchronized(this) {
        if (!Thread.holdsLock(this)) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Current thread is not the owner of this object's monitor");
        }
        this.notify();
    }
}
```

The `Thread.holdsLock(this)` method is used to check if the current thread is the owner of the object's monitor. If it is not, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is thrown with an appropriate error message. If the current thread is the owner of the monitor, the `notify()` method is called to wake up one waiting thread.
