Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the channel is closed before returning the local socket address. If the channel is closed, it throws a `ClosedChannelException`:

```java
import java.net.SocketAddress;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel;

public SocketAddress getLocalSocketAddress(SocketChannel channel) throws ClosedChannelException {
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    try {
        return channel.getLocalAddress();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the channel is open using the `isOpen()` method of the `SocketChannel` class. If the channel is closed, it throws a `ClosedChannelException`. If the channel is open, it retrieves the local socket address using the `getLocalAddress()` method of the `SocketChannel` class. If an exception occurs during the process, it prints the stack trace and returns `null`.
