Please write a java method that Reads the next value as a double and advances this va list's position.
Here's a Java method that reads the next value as a double and advances the position of the va list:

```
public static double getNextDouble(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner.hasNextDouble()) {
        double nextDouble = scanner.nextDouble();
        scanner.nextLine(); // advance the position of the va list
        return nextDouble;
    } else {
        throw new InputMismatchException("Next value is not a double");
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Scanner` object as input and checks if the next value in the va list is a double using the `hasNextDouble()` method. If it is, it reads the next double using the `nextDouble()` method and advances the position of the va list using the `nextLine()` method. If the next value is not a double, it throws an `InputMismatchException`.

Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNextDouble() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if the input is exhausted for java.util.Scanner.nextDouble() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.nextDouble() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if no line was found for java.util.Scanner.nextLine() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.nextLine() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```
public static double getNextDouble(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Scanner cannot be null");
    }
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("Input is exhausted");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNextDouble()) {
        throw new InputMismatchException("Next value is not a double");
    }
    double nextDouble = scanner.nextDouble();
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    scanner.nextLine(); // advance the position of the va list
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No line was found");
    }
    return nextDouble;
}
```

This method now includes checks for the scanner being null, closed, or exhausted, as well as checks for the next value not being a double or the next line not being found. It also checks for any exceptions that may occur during the `nextDouble()` and `nextLine()` methods. If any of these checks fail, the method throws the appropriate exception.

Here's the updated Java method that includes all the requested checks:

```
public static double getNextDouble(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Scanner cannot be null");
    }
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("Input is exhausted");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNextDouble()) {
        throw new InputMismatchException("Next value is not a double");
    }
    double nextDouble = scanner.nextDouble();
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    scanner.nextLine(); // advance the position of the va list
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No line was found");
    }
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    return nextDouble;
}
```

This method now includes checks for the scanner being null, closed, or exhausted, as well as checks for the next value not being a double or the next line not being found. It also checks for any exceptions that may occur during the `nextDouble()` and `nextLine()` methods. If any of these checks fail, the method throws the appropriate exception.
