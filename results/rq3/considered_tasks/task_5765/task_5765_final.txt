Here's an updated version of the `receivePacket` method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public void receivePacket(DatagramSocket socket) throws IOException {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buffer, buffer.length);
    
    // Check if setSoTimeout was previously called and the timeout has expired
    try {
        if (socket.getSoTimeout() > 0) {
            long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            socket.receive(packet);
            long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            if (endTime - startTime > socket.getSoTimeout()) {
                throw new SocketTimeoutException();
            }
        } else {
            socket.receive(packet);
        }
    } catch (SocketException e) {
        throw new SocketException("Error in underlying protocol, such as an UDP error.");
    }
    
    // Check if PortUnreachableException may be thrown
    if (socket.isConnected() && !socket.getInetAddress().isReachable(1000)) {
        throw new PortUnreachableException();
    }
    
    // Check if this socket has an associated channel and the channel is in non-blocking mode
    if (socket.getChannel() != null && socket.getChannel().isBlocking()) {
        throw new IllegalBlockingModeException();
    }
    
    String message = new String(packet.getData(), 0, packet.getLength());
    System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
}

// Check if a network error occurs
try {
    InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("example.com");
    if (!address.isReachable(1000)) {
        throw new IOException("Network error occurred.");
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new IOException("Network error occurred.");
}

// Check if timeout is negative
try {
    InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("example.com");
    if (address.isReachable(-1)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Timeout must be non-negative.");
    }
} catch (UnknownHostException e) {
    // Handle UnknownHostException
}

// Check if a security manager exists and its checkConnect method doesn't allow the operation
SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
if (securityManager != null) {
    try {
        InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("example.com");
        securityManager.checkConnect(address.getHostAddress(), -1);
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Security manager doesn't allow the operation.");
    }
}
```

This version of the method first checks if `setSoTimeout` was previously called and the timeout has expired as before.

Next, it checks if a `PortUnreachableException` may be thrown as before.

Finally, it checks if the socket has an associated channel and the channel is in non-blocking mode as before.

For the `isReachable` method, it checks if a network error occurs and throws an `IOException` with a more specific error message if so. It also checks if `timeout` is negative and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a more specific error message if so.

It also checks if a security manager exists and its `checkConnect` method doesn't allow the operation. If so, it throws a `SecurityException` with a more specific error message.
