You're right, it's important to handle any potential I/O errors that may occur when flushing the ObjectOutputStream or resetting it. Here's an updated version of the method that includes error handling:

```java
public static void drainObjectOutputStream(ObjectOutputStream oos) throws IOException {
    if (oos != null) {
        try {
            oos.flush();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error flushing ObjectOutputStream: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        if (oos instanceof ObjectOutputStream) {
            try {
                ((ObjectOutputStream) oos).reset();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error resetting ObjectOutputStream: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses try-catch blocks to catch any IOExceptions that may occur when flushing or resetting the ObjectOutputStream. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown as an IOException with a more descriptive error message.

Additionally, the method now checks if the ObjectOutputStream is an instance of ObjectOutputStream before calling the `reset()` method. This is because not all output streams support resetting, and calling `reset()` on an incompatible stream can result in an IOException.
