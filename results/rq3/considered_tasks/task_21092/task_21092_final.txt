
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class LobSize {
    public static long getMaxLobSize(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        
        DatabaseMetaData metaData = null;
        try {
            metaData = conn.getMetaData();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
        }
        
        long maxLobSize = 0;
        try {
            maxLobSize = metaData.getMaxLogicalLobSize();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
        }
        
        return maxLobSize;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the `Connection` object. If the connection is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

Next, the `getMetaData()` method is called inside a try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that may occur due to a database access error.

Finally, the `getMaxLogicalLobSize()` method is called inside another try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that may occur due to a database access error.

If any `SQLException` is caught, it is re-thrown with an appropriate message. Otherwise, the maximum LOB size is returned.
