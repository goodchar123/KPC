
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the calling thread's permission before setting the always-on-top property:

```java
public void setAlwaysOnTop(boolean alwaysOnTop) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkPermission(new AWTPermission("setWindowAlwaysOnTop"));
    }
    this.setAlwaysOnTop(alwaysOnTop);
}
```

This method first checks if there is a `SecurityManager` installed in the JVM. If there is, it calls the `checkPermission` method on the security manager to check if the calling thread has permission to set the always-on-top property. The permission that is checked is `AWTPermission("setWindowAlwaysOnTop")`.

If the calling thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method sets the always-on-top property using the `setAlwaysOnTop` method on the window object.

This updated method ensures that only threads with the appropriate permission can set the always-on-top property, which can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive windows.
