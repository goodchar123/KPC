Please write a java method that Sets whether this window should always be above other windows.
Here's a Java method that sets a window to always be above other windows:

```java
public void setAlwaysOnTop(boolean alwaysOnTop) {
    this.setAlwaysOnTop(alwaysOnTop);
}
```

This method takes a boolean parameter `alwaysOnTop` which specifies whether the window should always be on top of other windows. If `alwaysOnTop` is `true`, the window will always be on top of other windows. If `alwaysOnTop` is `false`, the window will not always be on top of other windows. 

You can call this method on a `Window` object to set its always-on-top property.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the calling thread does not have         permission to set the value of always on top property for java.awt.Window.setAlwaysOnTop(boolean) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the calling thread's permission before setting the always-on-top property:

```java
public void setAlwaysOnTop(boolean alwaysOnTop) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkPermission(new AWTPermission("setWindowAlwaysOnTop"));
    }
    this.setAlwaysOnTop(alwaysOnTop);
}
```

This method first checks if there is a `SecurityManager` installed in the JVM. If there is, it calls the `checkPermission` method on the security manager to check if the calling thread has permission to set the always-on-top property. The permission that is checked is `AWTPermission("setWindowAlwaysOnTop")`.

If the calling thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method sets the always-on-top property using the `setAlwaysOnTop` method on the window object.

This updated method ensures that only threads with the appropriate permission can set the always-on-top property, which can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive windows.
