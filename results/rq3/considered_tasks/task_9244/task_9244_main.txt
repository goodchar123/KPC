Please write a java method that Deletes a file if it exists.
Sure, here's a Java method that deletes a file if it exists:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileDeleter {
    public static void deleteIfExists(String filePath) {
        File file = new File(filePath);
        if (file.exists()) {
            file.delete();
            System.out.println("File deleted successfully.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("File does not exist.");
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes a file path as a parameter and checks if the file exists. If it does, it deletes the file using the `delete()` method of the `File` class. If the file does not exist, it prints a message saying so.

Please check If a security manager exists and its SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)          method denies read access to the file or directory for java.io.File.exists() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check If a security manager exists and its SecurityManager.checkDelete(java.lang.String) method denies          delete access to the file for java.io.File.delete() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the existence of a security manager and calls the appropriate `checkRead()` and `checkDelete()` methods:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.security.AccessControlException;
import java.security.Permission;

public class FileDeleter {
    public static void deleteIfExists(String filePath) throws SecurityException {
        SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (securityManager != null) {
            try {
                securityManager.checkRead(filePath);
                securityManager.checkDelete(filePath);
            } catch (AccessControlException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Access denied", e);
            }
        }
        
        File file = new File(filePath);
        if (file.exists()) {
            if (!file.delete()) {
                throw new SecurityException("Failed to delete file");
            }
            System.out.println("File deleted successfully.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("File does not exist.");
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager exists using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager exists, it calls the `checkRead()` and `checkDelete()` methods to check for read and delete access to the file. If either of these methods throws an `AccessControlException`, the method throws a `SecurityException` with the original exception as the cause.

If the security checks pass, the method proceeds to delete the file using the `delete()` method of the `File` class. If the file does not exist, it prints a message saying so. If the `delete()` method returns `false`, indicating that the file was not deleted, the method throws a `SecurityException`.

            }
        }
        
        File file = new File(filePath);
