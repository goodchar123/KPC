
You're right, it's a good practice to check for I/O errors when calling `available()` and `close()` on an `InputStream`. Here's an updated version of the code that checks for errors and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import javax.swing.ProgressMonitor;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        InputStream in = new FileInputStream("example.txt");
        int available = in.available();
        if (available < 0) {
            throw new IOException("Error getting available bytes");
        }
        ProgressMonitor monitor = new ProgressMonitor(null, "Reading file", "", 0, available / 1024);
        InputStream monitoredIn = new MonitoredInputStream(in, monitor);
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int bytesRead;
        try {
            while ((bytesRead = monitoredIn.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                // do something with the data
            }
        } finally {
            try {
                monitoredIn.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // log or handle the error
                throw new IOException("Error closing input stream", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, the `available()` method is called on the `FileInputStream` and the result is checked for errors. If `available()` returns a negative value, an `IOException` is thrown with an error message. Otherwise, the `ProgressMonitor` is created with the maximum value set to the size of the file in kilobytes, and the `read` method is called in a loop to read data from the input stream. The `finally` block ensures that the input stream is closed even if an exception is thrown. The `close()` method is called on the `MonitoredInputStream`, and any `IOException` that occurs is caught and re-thrown with an error message.
