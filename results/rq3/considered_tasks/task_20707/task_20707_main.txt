Please write a java method that Retrieves the fully-qualified SQL name of the SQL structured type that this Ref object references.
Sure, here's a Java method that retrieves the fully-qualified SQL name of the SQL structured type that a Ref object references:

```java
public String getSQLTypeName(Ref ref) throws SQLException {
    Struct struct = ref.getStruct();
    String typeName = struct.getSQLTypeName();
    return typeName;
}
```

This method takes a `Ref` object as input and returns a `String` representing the fully-qualified SQL name of the SQL structured type that the `Ref` object references. 

First, the method calls the `getStruct()` method on the `Ref` object to retrieve the `Struct` object that the `Ref` references. Then, it calls the `getSQLTypeName()` method on the `Struct` object to retrieve the fully-qualified SQL name of the structured type. Finally, the method returns this name as a `String`. 

Note that this method throws a `SQLException` if there is an error retrieving the SQL type name.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.Struct.getSQLTypeName() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.Struct.getSQLTypeName() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and unsupported methods:

```java
public String getSQLTypeName(Ref ref) throws SQLException {
    Struct struct = ref.getStruct();
    if (struct == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving Struct object");
    }
    try {
        String typeName = struct.getSQLTypeName();
        return typeName;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported by JDBC driver", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method first calls the `getStruct()` method on the `Ref` object to retrieve the `Struct` object that the `Ref` references. If the `Struct` object is `null`, it throws a `SQLException` with an error message indicating that there was an error retrieving the `Struct` object.

Next, the method tries to call the `getSQLTypeName()` method on the `Struct` object to retrieve the fully-qualified SQL name of the structured type. If this method call throws a `SQLException` with an error code of 0, it means that the JDBC driver does not support this method, so the method throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with the original exception as the cause. Otherwise, the method re-throws the original `SQLException`.

Note that this method now handles both database access errors and unsupported methods, and throws the appropriate exceptions in each case.
