
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and unsupported methods:

```java
public String getSQLTypeName(Ref ref) throws SQLException {
    Struct struct = ref.getStruct();
    if (struct == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving Struct object");
    }
    try {
        String typeName = struct.getSQLTypeName();
        return typeName;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported by JDBC driver", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method first calls the `getStruct()` method on the `Ref` object to retrieve the `Struct` object that the `Ref` references. If the `Struct` object is `null`, it throws a `SQLException` with an error message indicating that there was an error retrieving the `Struct` object.

Next, the method tries to call the `getSQLTypeName()` method on the `Struct` object to retrieve the fully-qualified SQL name of the structured type. If this method call throws a `SQLException` with an error code of 0, it means that the JDBC driver does not support this method, so the method throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with the original exception as the cause. Otherwise, the method re-throws the original `SQLException`.

Note that this method now handles both database access errors and unsupported methods, and throws the appropriate exceptions in each case.
