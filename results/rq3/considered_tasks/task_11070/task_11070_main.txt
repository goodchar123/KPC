Please write a java method that Truncates the entity, to which this channel is connected, to the given size.
Here's a Java method that truncates an entity to a given size:

```java
public void truncateEntity(int size) {
    // Check if the entity is already smaller than the given size
    if (entity.length() <= size) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Truncate the entity to the given size
    entity = entity.substring(0, size);
}
```

This method takes an integer `size` as input, which represents the maximum size that the entity should be truncated to. If the current length of the entity is already smaller than or equal to the given size, the method simply returns without doing anything. Otherwise, it truncates the entity to the given size by using the `substring()` method to extract a substring of the first `size` characters of the entity. The truncated entity is then stored back in the `entity` variable.

Please check if the             beginIndex is negative, or             endIndex is larger than the length of             this String object, or             beginIndex is larger than             endIndex. for java.lang.String.substring(int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of them are true:

```java
public void truncateEntity(int size) {
    // Check if the entity is already smaller than the given size
    if (entity.length() <= size) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Truncate the entity to the given size
    try {
        entity = entity.substring(0, size);
    } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Invalid indices for substring: beginIndex is negative, or endIndex is larger than the length of this String object, or beginIndex is larger than endIndex.");
    }
}
```

This method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `IndexOutOfBoundsException` that may be thrown by the `substring()` method. If such an exception is caught, it is re-thrown as a new `IndexOutOfBoundsException` with a custom error message that explains the invalid indices for the substring.
