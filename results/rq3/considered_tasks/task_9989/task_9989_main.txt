Please write a java method that Specify stream protocol version to use when writing the stream.
Here is a Java method that specifies the stream protocol version to use when writing the stream:

```java
public void setStreamProtocolVersion(OutputStream outputStream, int version) throws IOException {
    if (outputStream instanceof ObjectOutputStream) {
        ((ObjectOutputStream) outputStream).useProtocolVersion(version);
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Output stream is not an instance of ObjectOutputStream");
    }
}
```

This method takes an `OutputStream` object and an integer `version` as parameters. It checks if the `OutputStream` is an instance of `ObjectOutputStream` and if so, it calls the `useProtocolVersion` method on it, passing in the `version` parameter. If the `OutputStream` is not an instance of `ObjectOutputStream`, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. 

You can call this method with an `OutputStream` object and the desired protocol version to use when writing the stream.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if called after any objects          have been serialized. for java.io.ObjectOutputStream.useProtocolVersion(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if invalid version is passed in. for java.io.ObjectOutputStream.useProtocolVersion(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Here is the updated Java method that checks if any objects have been serialized before calling `useProtocolVersion` and also checks if an invalid version is passed in:

```java
public void setStreamProtocolVersion(OutputStream outputStream, int version) throws IOException {
    if (outputStream instanceof ObjectOutputStream) {
        ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream = (ObjectOutputStream) outputStream;
        if (objectOutputStream.size() > 0) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot set protocol version after objects have been serialized");
        }
        if (version != ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1 && version != ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_2) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid protocol version: " + version);
        }
        objectOutputStream.useProtocolVersion(version);
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Output stream is not an instance of ObjectOutputStream");
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if any objects have been serialized by calling the `size` method on the `ObjectOutputStream` object. If the size is greater than 0, it throws an `IllegalStateException` indicating that the protocol version cannot be set after objects have been serialized.

Next, it checks if the version passed in is valid. The `ObjectOutputStream` class defines two protocol versions: `PROTOCOL_VERSION_1` and `PROTOCOL_VERSION_2`. If the version passed in is not one of these two values, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.

Finally, if the `OutputStream` is an instance of `ObjectOutputStream`, it calls the `useProtocolVersion` method on it, passing in the `version` parameter.

You can call this updated method with an `OutputStream` object and the desired protocol version to use when writing the stream.
