Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for an I/O error when calling the `flush()` method of the `BufferedWriter` class:

```java
public void writeToBuffer(char[] chars, BufferedWriter buffer) throws IOException {
    for (char c : chars) {
        buffer.write(c);
    }
    try {
        buffer.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while flushing the buffer.", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first writes the characters to the buffer as before. Then, it tries to flush the buffer using the `flush()` method of the `BufferedWriter` class. If an `IOException` is thrown during the flush operation, the method catches the exception and throws a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message.

Note that this method still throws an `IOException` if one occurs during the write operation itself, as in the original version.
