Please write a java method that Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows that any ResultSet object  generated by this Statement object can contain to the given number.
Here's a Java method that sets the maximum number of rows for a ResultSet object generated by a Statement object:

```java
public void setMaxRows(int maxRows) throws SQLException {
    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
    stmt.setMaxRows(maxRows);
}
```

In this method, `conn` is a Connection object that represents the database connection. The `setMaxRows()` method sets the maximum number of rows for the ResultSet object generated by the Statement object to the given `maxRows` value. If `maxRows` is zero, it means there is no limit to the number of rows in the ResultSet. 

Note that this method throws a SQLException if there is a database access error or the value specified for `maxRows` is less than zero.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.createStatement() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs, this method is called on a closed Statement            or the condition max >= 0 is not satisfied for java.sql.Statement.setMaxRows(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public void setMaxRows(int maxRows) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed.");
    }
    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
    try {
        if (maxRows < 0) {
            throw new SQLException("Invalid maxRows value: " + maxRows);
        }
        stmt.setMaxRows(maxRows);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        stmt.close();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

In this updated method, we first check if the connection is closed. If it is, we throw a SQLException with an appropriate error message.

Next, we create a new Statement object and set its maximum number of rows using the `setMaxRows()` method. However, we also wrap this in a try-catch block to catch any SQLException that may occur. If an exception is caught, we close the Statement object and re-throw the exception.

Additionally, we also check if the `maxRows` value is less than zero. If it is, we throw a SQLException with an appropriate error message.

This updated method should handle all the error conditions you specified.
