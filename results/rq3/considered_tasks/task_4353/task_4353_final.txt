Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the specified exceptions:

```java
public void renameNode(Node node, String newName) throws DOMException {
    if (node.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE || node.getNodeType() == Node.ATTRIBUTE_NODE) {
        try {
            Node renamedNode = node.getOwnerDocument().renameNode(node, null, newName);
            System.out.println("Node renamed from " + node.getNodeName() + " to " + renamedNode.getNodeName());
        } catch (DOMException e) {
            throw e;
        }
    } else {
        throw new DOMException(DOMException.NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR, "Node is not of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE");
    }
}
```

This version of the method includes a `throws` clause for `DOMException`, which is the exception that is thrown by the `renameNode()` method if any of the specified errors occur. 

If the node is not of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE, the method throws a new `DOMException` with the `NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR` code and a message indicating that the node cannot be renamed. 

If the new name is not a valid XML name, the `renameNode()` method will throw a `DOMException` with the `INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR` code. 

If the node being renamed was created from a different document than the current document, the `renameNode()` method will throw a `DOMException` with the `WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR` code. 

If the qualified name is malformed or the namespace is incorrect, the `renameNode()` method will throw a `DOMException` with the `NAMESPACE_ERR` code. 

If the node being renamed is an attribute and the qualified name or prefix is "xmlns" but the namespace URI is incorrect, the `renameNode()` method will also throw a `DOMException` with the `NAMESPACE_ERR` code.

In this updated version of the method, if any of these exceptions are thrown by the `renameNode()` method, they are caught and re-thrown by the method itself.
