Please write a java method that Rename an existing node of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE.
Here's a Java method that renames an existing node of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE:

```java
public void renameNode(Node node, String newName) {
    if (node.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE || node.getNodeType() == Node.ATTRIBUTE_NODE) {
        Node renamedNode = node.getOwnerDocument().renameNode(node, null, newName);
        System.out.println("Node renamed from " + node.getNodeName() + " to " + renamedNode.getNodeName());
    } else {
        System.out.println("Node is not of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE");
    }
}
```

This method takes in two parameters: the node to be renamed and the new name for the node. It first checks if the node is of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE. If it is, it uses the `renameNode()` method of the node's owner document to rename the node with the new name. It then prints out a message indicating the old and new names of the node. If the node is not of the correct type, it prints out a message indicating that the node cannot be renamed.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Raised when the type of the specified node is   neither ELEMENT_NODE nor ATTRIBUTE_NODE,   or if the implementation does not support the renaming of the   document element.   INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the new qualified name is not an   XML name according to the XML version in use specified in the   Document.xmlVersion attribute.   WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised when the specified node was created   from a different document than this document.   NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the qualifiedName is a   malformed qualified name, if the qualifiedName has a   prefix and the namespaceURI is null, or   if the qualifiedName has a prefix that is "xml" and   the namespaceURI is different from "   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" [XML Namespaces]   . Also raised, when the node being renamed is an attribute, if the   qualifiedName, or its prefix, is "xmlns" and the   namespaceURI is different from "http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/". for org.w3c.dom.Document.renameNode(org.w3c.dom.Node,java.lang.String,java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DOMException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the specified exceptions:

```java
public void renameNode(Node node, String newName) throws DOMException {
    if (node.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE || node.getNodeType() == Node.ATTRIBUTE_NODE) {
        Node renamedNode = node.getOwnerDocument().renameNode(node, null, newName);
        System.out.println("Node renamed from " + node.getNodeName() + " to " + renamedNode.getNodeName());
    } else {
        throw new DOMException(DOMException.NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR, "Node is not of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE");
    }
}
```

This version of the method includes a `throws` clause for `DOMException`, which is the exception that is thrown by the `renameNode()` method if any of the specified errors occur. 

If the node is not of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE, the method throws a new `DOMException` with the `NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR` code and a message indicating that the node cannot be renamed. 

If the new name is not a valid XML name, the `renameNode()` method will throw a `DOMException` with the `INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR` code. 

If the node being renamed was created from a different document than the current document, the `renameNode()` method will throw a `DOMException` with the `WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR` code. 

If the qualified name is malformed or the namespace is incorrect, the `renameNode()` method will throw a `DOMException` with the `NAMESPACE_ERR` code. 

If the node being renamed is an attribute and the qualified name or prefix is "xmlns" but the namespace URI is incorrect, the `renameNode()` method will also throw a `DOMException` with the `NAMESPACE_ERR` code.

            System.out.println("Node renamed from " + node.getNodeName() + " to " + renamedNode.getNodeName());
        } catch (DOMException e) {
            throw e;
        }
    } else {
        throw new DOMException(DOMException.NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR, "Node is not of type ELEMENT_NODE or ATTRIBUTE_NODE");
    }
}

In this updated version of the method, if any of these exceptions are thrown by the `renameNode()` method, they are caught and re-thrown by the method itself.
