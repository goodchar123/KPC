Please write a java method that Returns true if the next token in this scanner's input can be interpreted as a long value in the specified radix using the nextLong() method.
Here's the Java method that returns true if the next token in the scanner's input can be interpreted as a long value in the specified radix using the nextLong() method:

```java
public static boolean hasNextLongInRadix(Scanner scanner, int radix) {
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        return false;
    }
    String nextToken = scanner.next();
    try {
        scanner.close();
        scanner = new Scanner(nextToken);
        scanner.useRadix(radix);
        scanner.nextLong();
        return true;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return false;
    } finally {
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This method takes a Scanner object and an integer radix as parameters. It first checks if the scanner has a next token. If not, it returns false. If there is a next token, it tries to parse it as a long value in the specified radix using the nextLong() method. If the parsing is successful, it returns true. If there is an exception during parsing, it returns false. Finally, it closes the scanner object.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNext() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if no more tokens are available for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if radix is out of range for java.util.Scanner.useRadix(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if the next token does not match the Integer         regular expression, or is out of range for java.util.Scanner.nextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InputMismatchException.
Please check if input is exhausted for java.util.Scanner.nextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.nextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested error checking:

```java
public static boolean hasNextLongInRadix(Scanner scanner, int radix) {
    if (scanner == null || scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No more tokens available");
    }
    String nextToken = scanner.next();
    try {
        scanner.close();
        scanner = new Scanner(nextToken);
        scanner.useRadix(radix);
        long value = scanner.nextLong();
        if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
            throw scanner.ioException();
        }
        return true;
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        throw new InputMismatchException("Token does not match the Integer regular expression, or is out of range");
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Radix is out of range");
    } finally {
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the scanner is closed or has an I/O exception. If so, it throws an IllegalStateException. It then checks if there are more tokens available. If not, it throws a NoSuchElementException. It then tries to parse the next token as a long value in the specified radix using the nextLong() method. If the parsing is successful, it returns true. If there is a NumberFormatException, it throws an InputMismatchException. If the radix is out of range, it throws an IllegalArgumentException. If there is an I/O exception during parsing, it throws the exception. Finally, it closes the scanner object.
