
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks if the current thread is allowed to create or start a thread before calling `Cleaner.create()`. If the current thread is not allowed, a `SecurityException` is thrown:

```
import java.lang.ref.Cleaner;

public class SharedScope {
    private static final Cleaner cleaner;

    static {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThreadGroup"));
        }
        cleaner = Cleaner.create();
    }

    private final Object resource;
    private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;

    public SharedScope(Object resource) {
        this.resource = resource;
        this.cleanable = cleaner.register(this, () -> {
            // Clean up the resource when the scope is closed
            // For example, release any locks or close any streams
            System.out.println("Cleaning up shared resource");
        });
    }

    public void close() {
        // Close the scope and trigger the cleaner
        cleanable.clean();
    }
}
```

In this version, we first check if there is a `SecurityManager` present, and if so, we call `checkPermission()` to check if the current thread is allowed to modify the thread group (which is required to create or start
