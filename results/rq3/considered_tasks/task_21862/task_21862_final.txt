
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the JShell instance could not be created and throws an `IllegalStateException` if that's the case:

```java
import jdk.jshell.JShell;

public class JShellEngine {
    public static JShell createJShellEngine() {
        JShell jshell = JShell.create();
        if (jshell == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Failed to create JShell instance");
        }
        return jshell;
    }
}
```

This method first creates a new instance of `JShell` using the `create()` method. It then checks if the `jshell` variable is `null`, which would indicate that the JShell instance could not be created. If that's the case, it throws an `IllegalStateException` with an error message. Otherwise, it returns the new `JShell` instance.
