Please write a java method that Create a new JShell state engine.
Sure, here's a Java method that creates a new JShell state engine:

```java
import jdk.jshell.JShell;

public class JShellEngine {
    public static JShell createJShellEngine() {
        JShell jshell = JShell.create();
        return jshell;
    }
}
```

This method imports the `JShell` class from the `jdk.jshell` package and creates a new instance of `JShell` using the `create()` method. It then returns the new `JShell` instance.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the JShell instance could not be created. for jdk.jshell.JShell.create() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the JShell instance could not be created and throws an `IllegalStateException` if that's the case:

```java
import jdk.jshell.JShell;

public class JShellEngine {
    public static JShell createJShellEngine() {
        JShell jshell = JShell.create();
        if (jshell == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Failed to create JShell instance");
        }
        return jshell;
    }
}
```

This method first creates a new instance of `JShell` using the `create()` method. It then checks if the `jshell` variable is `null`, which would indicate that the JShell instance could not be created. If that's the case, it throws an `IllegalStateException` with an error message. Otherwise, it returns the new `JShell` instance.
