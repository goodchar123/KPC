
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes error handling for the scenarios you mentioned:

```java
public OutputStream getAsciiOutputStream(Clob clob, long pos) throws SQLException, IOException {
    // Check if pos is less than 1
    if (pos < 1) {
        throw new SQLException("Invalid position specified");
    }

    // Get a writer to the CLOB object
    Writer writer;
    try {
        writer = clob.setCharacterStream(pos);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error accessing CLOB value", e);
    }

    // Create an output stream that writes ASCII characters to the writer
    OutputStream outputStream = new OutputStream() {
        @Override
        public void write(int b) throws IOException {
            try {
                writer.write(b);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error writing to writer", e);
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
            try {
                writer.write(new String(b, off, len, "US-ASCII"));
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error writing to writer", e);
            }
        }
    };

    // Check if the JDBC driver supports this method
    try {
        clob.setCharacterStream(pos);
    } catch (SQLFeatureNotSupportedException e) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support this method", e);
    }

    return outputStream;
}
```

This updated method includes error handling for the scenarios you mentioned. If an error occurs while accessing the CLOB value or if pos is less than 1, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate error message. If the JDBC driver does not support the `setCharacterStream` method, a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown. If an I/O error occurs while writing to the output stream or the writer, an `IOException` is thrown with an appropriate error message.
