Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if a security manager has been installed and denies `RuntimePermission("getFileSystemAttributes")` or `SecurityManager.checkRead(String)` method denies read access to the file named by the abstract pathname:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.security.AccessController;
import java.security.PrivilegedActionException;
import java.security.PrivilegedExceptionAction;

public class DiskSpaceChecker {
    public static long getFreeSpace(String path) throws SecurityException {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            try {
                sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("getFileSystemAttributes"));
                sm.checkRead(path);
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Access denied to get free space on partition: " + path, e);
            }
        }
        try {
            return AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedExceptionAction<Long>() {
                public Long run() throws Exception {
                    File file = new File(path);
                    return file.getFreeSpace();
                }
            });
        } catch (PrivilegedActionException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("Access denied to get free space on partition: " + path, e);
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager is installed using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is installed, it checks if the `RuntimePermission("getFileSystemAttributes")` and `SecurityManager.checkRead(String)` methods allow access to the file named by the abstract pathname. If access is denied, it throws a `SecurityException` with a message indicating the access was denied.

If access is allowed, the method uses `AccessController.doPrivileged()` to execute the `File.getFreeSpace()` method with the necessary privileges. If an exception occurs during the privileged action, it throws a `SecurityException` with a message indicating the access was denied.

Note that this method throws a `SecurityException` instead of returning a value if access is denied, as the `getFreeSpace()` method itself does not throw any exceptions.
