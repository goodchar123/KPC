Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for errors in the underlying protocol and throws a `SocketException` if necessary:

```java
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.SocketException;

public int getSoTimeoutSetting(Socket socket) throws SocketException {
    try {
        return socket.getSoTimeout();
    } catch (SocketException se) {
        throw se;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        throw new SocketException("Error in underlying protocol: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method now throws a `SocketException` if there is an error in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error. If the `getSoTimeout()` method throws a `SocketException`, it is simply re-thrown. Otherwise, if any other exception occurs, the method prints the stack trace and throws a new `SocketException` with a message indicating that there was an error in the underlying protocol.
