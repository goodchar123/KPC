Please write a java method that Deactivates the connector server, that is, stops listening for client connections.
Here's a Java method that deactivates the connector server:

```java
public void deactivateConnectorServer() {
    try {
        // Get the JMX connector server
        JMXConnectorServer connectorServer = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().getMBeanServerDelegate().getConnectorServer();

        // Stop listening for client connections
        connectorServer.stop();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle the exception
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This method uses the `ManagementFactory` class to get the JMX connector server, and then calls the `stop()` method to stop listening for client connections. If an `IOException` occurs, it is caught and printed to the console.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if there is a security manager and the caller does not have the permission required by MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer(). for java.lang.management.ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a security manager and the required permission:

```java
public void deactivateConnectorServer() throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        // Check if the caller has the required permission
        try {
            sm.checkPermission(new MBeanServerPermission("createMBeanServer"));
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // Throw a SecurityException if the caller doesn't have the required permission
            throw new SecurityException("Caller does not have the required permission to create MBeanServer", e);
        }
    }

    try {
        // Get the JMX connector server
        JMXConnectorServer connectorServer = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().getMBeanServerDelegate().getConnectorServer();

        // Stop listening for client connections
        connectorServer.stop();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle the exception
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if there is a security manager using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If there is, it checks if the caller has the required permission using `SecurityManager.checkPermission()`. If the caller doesn't have the required permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the caller has the required permission or there is no security manager, the method proceeds to get the JMX connector server and stop listening for client connections as before.
