
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error when writing to the `FileOutputStream` and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class RecordingWriter {
    
    public static void writeRecordingToFile(byte[] recordingData, String filePath) throws IOException {
        File file = new File(filePath);
        FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(file);
        try {
            outputStream.write(recordingData);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing to FileOutputStream: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                outputStream.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error closing FileOutputStream: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `IOException` that may occur when writing to the `FileOutputStream`. If an `IOException` is caught, the method throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating the error that occurred.

Additionally, the method uses a `finally` block to ensure that the `FileOutputStream` is properly closed, even if an error occurs when writing to it. If an error occurs when closing the `FileOutputStream`, the method throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating the error that occurred.

By doing this, any errors that occur when writing to or closing the `FileOutputStream` will be properly handled and reported to the caller of the method.
