You are correct, it is important to handle the cases where the end of file is reached, the stream has been closed, or other I/O errors occur when calling `readByte()` and `available()` in the `readStreamHeader()` method. Here is an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```java
protected void readStreamHeader() throws IOException, StreamCorruptedException {
    // Check if the stream header has already been read
    if (bin.readByte() != STREAM_MAGIC || bin.readByte() != STREAM_VERSION) {
        throw new StreamCorruptedException("Invalid stream header");
    }
    // Reset the handle table
    handles.clear();
    // Reset the depth counter
    depth = 0;
    
    // Check if end of file is reached
    if (bin instanceof DataInputStream && ((DataInputStream) bin).readByte() == -1) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    
    // Check if the stream has been closed or another I/O error occurs
    if (bin instanceof FileInputStream && ((FileInputStream) bin).getChannel().isOpen() == false) {
        throw new IOException("Stream has been closed");
    }
    
    // Check for other I/O errors
    int available = bin.available();
    if (available == 0) {
        throw new IOException("End of stream reached unexpectedly");
    } else if (available < 0) {
        throw new IOException("Stream is closed");
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if the end of file is reached by calling `readByte()` on a `DataInputStream` instance. If the result is -1, we throw an `EOFException`. We also check if the stream has been closed or another I/O error occurs by checking if the input stream is a `FileInputStream` instance and its channel is closed. If the channel is closed, we throw an `IOException` with the message "Stream has been closed". Finally, we check for other I/O errors by calling `available()` on the input stream. If the result is 0, we throw an `IOException` with the message "End of stream reached unexpectedly". If the result is negative, we throw an `IOException` with the message "Stream is closed".
