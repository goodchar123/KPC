Yes, you can add a call to `checkAccess()` before calling `enumerate()` to ensure that the current thread has permission to access the specified thread group. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` will be thrown.

Here's an updated version of the method that includes the `checkAccess()` call:

```
public static void copyActiveThreads(ThreadGroup group, Thread[] threads) {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkAccess(group);
    }
    int numThreads = group.activeCount();
    Thread[] allThreads = new Thread[numThreads];
