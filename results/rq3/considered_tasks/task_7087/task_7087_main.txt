Please write a java method that Copies into the specified array every active thread in this thread group.
Here's a Java method that copies every active thread in a specified thread group into an array:

```
public static void copyActiveThreads(ThreadGroup group, Thread[] threads) {
    int numThreads = group.activeCount();
    Thread[] allThreads = new Thread[numThreads];
    group.enumerate(allThreads);
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
        if (allThreads[i].isAlive()) {
            threads[count] = allThreads[i];
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes in a `ThreadGroup` object and an array of `Thread` objects. It first gets the number of active threads in the specified thread group using the `activeCount()` method. It then creates a new array of `Thread` objects with the same size as the number of active threads and populates it with all the threads in the thread group using the `enumerate()` method.

Next, it loops through all the threads in the new array and checks if each thread is alive using the `isAlive()` method. If a thread is alive, it adds it to the specified `threads` array and increments the `count` variable.

Finally, the method returns the `threads` array with all the active threads in the specified thread group.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if checkAccess determines that          the current thread cannot access this thread group for java.lang.ThreadGroup.enumerate(java.lang.Thread[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Yes, you can add a call to `checkAccess()` before calling `enumerate()` to ensure that the current thread has permission to access the specified thread group. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` will be thrown.

Here's an updated version of the method that includes the `checkAccess()` call:

```
public static void copyActiveThreads(ThreadGroup group, Thread[] threads) {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkAccess(group);
    }
    int numThreads = group.activeCount();
    Thread[] allThreads = new Thread[numThreads];
    group.enumerate(allThreads);
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
        if (allThreads[i].isAlive()) {
            threads[count] = allThreads[i];
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If one is installed, it calls `checkAccess()` on the specified thread group to ensure that the current thread has permission to access it. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` will be thrown.

If the current thread has permission, the method proceeds as before, getting the number of active threads in the specified thread group, populating a new array with all the threads in the group, and adding all the active threads to the specified `threads` array.
