Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this duration with the specified duration subtracted.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a duration with the specified duration subtracted:

```java
public Duration subtract(Duration duration) {
    return this.minus(duration);
}
```

This method uses the `minus()` method of the `Duration` class to subtract the specified duration from the current duration and return a new `Duration` object that represents the result. The `minus()` method returns a new `Duration` object and does not modify the original duration, so this method returns a copy of the duration with the specified duration subtracted.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.Duration.minus(java.time.Duration) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for numeric overflow and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it occurs:

```java
public Duration subtract(Duration duration) {
    try {
        return this.minus(duration);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while subtracting durations.");
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may be thrown by the `minus()` method if a numeric overflow occurs. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message indicating that a numeric overflow occurred while subtracting durations. This ensures that the caller of the method is aware of the issue and can handle it appropriately.
