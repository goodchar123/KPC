Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for numeric overflow and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it occurs:

```java
public Duration subtract(Duration duration) {
    try {
        return this.minus(duration);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while subtracting durations.");
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may be thrown by the `minus()` method if a numeric overflow occurs. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message indicating that a numeric overflow occurred while subtracting durations. This ensures that the caller of the method is aware of the issue and can handle it appropriately.
