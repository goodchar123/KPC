Here is an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks:

```
/**
 * Reads a single character from the input stream.
 *
 * @return the next character from the input stream as a char
 * @throws EOFException if the end of the input stream is reached before all bytes are read
 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
 */
public char readChar() throws EOFException, IOException {
    int b1 = in.read();
    if (b1 == -1) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    int b2 = in.read();
    if (b2 == -1) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return (char) ((b1 << 8) + (b2 << 0));
}
```

This updated method checks for two conditions:

1. If the end of the input stream is reached before all bytes are read, an EOFException is thrown.
2. If an I/O error occurs while reading the bytes, an IOException is thrown.

The method reads two bytes from the input stream and combines them
