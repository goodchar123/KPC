Please write a java method that See the general contract of the readChar method of DataInput.
Here is an example of a Java method that outlines the general contract of the readChar method of DataInput:

```
/**
 * Reads a single character from the input stream.
 *
 * @return the next character from the input stream as a char
 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
 */
public char readChar() throws IOException {
    // Implementation details
}
```

The general contract of the readChar method of DataInput is as follows:

1. The method reads a single character from the input stream.
2. The character is returned as a char.
3. If the end of the input stream is reached before a character can be read, the method throws an EOFException.
4. If an I/O error occurs while reading the character, the method throws an IOException.
5. The method does not block waiting for input. If no character is available, the method returns immediately with a value of -1.
6. The method is intended to be used with character-based input streams, such as those created with InputStreamReader. If used with a byte-based input stream, the behavior is undefined.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this stream reaches the end before reading               all the bytes. for java.io.DataInput.readChar() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw EOFException.
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.DataInput.readChar() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Here is an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks:

```
/**
 * Reads a single character from the input stream.
 *
 * @return the next character from the input stream as a char
 * @throws EOFException if the end of the input stream is reached before all bytes are read
 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
 */
public char readChar() throws EOFException, IOException {
    int b1 = in.read();
    if (b1 == -1) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    int b2 = in.read();
    if (b2 == -1) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return (char) ((b1 << 8) + (b2 << 0));
}
```

This updated method checks for two conditions:

1. If the end of the input stream is reached before all bytes are read, an EOFException is thrown.
2. If an I/O error occurs while reading the bytes, an IOException is thrown.

The method reads two bytes from the input stream and combines them into a single char value, which is then returned.
