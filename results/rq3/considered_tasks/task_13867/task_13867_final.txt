Sure, here's the updated code that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of them are true:

```java
public static String getLanguageAbbreviation(Locale locale) {
    String languageCode = locale.getLanguage();
    if (languageCode.length() < 3) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Language code is too short to get abbreviation");
    }
    try {
        return languageCode.substring(0, 3);
    } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Invalid substring parameters: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the length of the language code is less than 3, which would mean that it's not possible to get a three-letter abbreviation. If this is the case, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` with a message indicating that the language code is too short.

If the language code is long enough, the method then tries to call `substring()` with the parameters `0` and `3` to get the first three characters of the language code. If any of the conditions you mentioned are met (i.e. `beginIndex` is negative, `endIndex` is larger than the length of the string, or `beginIndex` is larger than `endIndex`), then an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown with a message indicating the invalid parameters.

Note that the `try-catch` block is not strictly necessary, since `substring()` will already throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of the conditions are met. However, including the `try-catch` block allows us to provide a more informative error message.
