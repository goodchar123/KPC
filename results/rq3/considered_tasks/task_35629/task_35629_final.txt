
Here's the updated Java method that checks if any thread has interrupted the current thread and throws `InterruptedException` if so, and also checks if a `Throwable` is thrown when running the `Runnable` and throws `InvocationTargetException` if so:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException;

public class FocusOwnerHelper {
    public static Component getFocusOwner() throws InterruptedException, InvocationTargetException {
        Component focusOwner = null;
        try {
            focusOwner = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager().getFocusOwner();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // If the calling thread is in a different context than the focus owner,
            // a SecurityException will be thrown. In this case, we need to use
            // EventQueue.invokeAndWait() to execute the code in the context of the
            // event dispatch thread.
            try {
                EventQueue.invokeAndWait(new Runnable() {
                    public void run() {
                        focusOwner = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager().getFocusOwner();
                    }
                });
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
                throw ex;
            } catch (InvocationTargetException ex) {
                throw ex;
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                ex.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        return focusOwner;
    }
}
```

This updated method adds two catch blocks to handle `InterruptedException` and `InvocationTargetException`. If the `Runnable` passed to `EventQueue.invokeAndWait()` throws an `InterruptedException`, we throw the same exception. If it throws an `InvocationTargetException`, we throw that exception instead. If any other exception is thrown, we simply print the stack trace.

Note that we also added `throws InterruptedException, InvocationTargetException` to the method signature to indicate that these exceptions may be thrown.
