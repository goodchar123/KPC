
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned:

```
public NClob createNClob(Connection conn, String str) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    try {
        NClob nclob = conn.createNClob();
        nclob.setString(1, str);
        return nclob;
    } catch (SQLFeatureNotSupportedException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error creating NClob object", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `Connection` object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

Next, it tries to create a new `NClob` object using the `createNClob()` method of the `Connection` object and sets its contents to the given `String`. If this operation fails due to a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with an appropriate error message. If it fails due to any other `SQLException`, it throws a new `SQLException` with an appropriate error message and the original exception as the cause.

This updated method should handle the conditions you mentioned and provide appropriate error messages.
