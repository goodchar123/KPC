
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for an I/O error when closing the Writer and throws an IOException if one occurs:

```java
public void writeClob(Clob clob, String data, long pos) throws SQLException, IOException {
    // Convert the String to a character array
    char[] charData = data.toCharArray();
    
    // Get a writer object for the CLOB
    Writer writer = clob.setCharacterStream(pos);
    
    // Write the character data to the CLOB
    writer.write(charData);
    
    // Close the writer and check for I/O errors
    try {
        writer.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error closing CLOB writer: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This version of the method adds a try-catch block around the call to `writer.close()`, and catches any IOException that may be thrown. If an IOException occurs, the method throws a new IOException with a message that includes the original exception's message. This way, the caller of the method can handle the exception appropriately.
