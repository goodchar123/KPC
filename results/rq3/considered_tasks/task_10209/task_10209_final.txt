Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public void appendToWriter(Writer writer, CharSequence charSequence) throws IOException {
    try {
        writer.append(charSequence);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while appending to the writer.", e);
    }
}
```

This method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `IOException` that may occur while calling the `append()` method on the `writer` object. If an `IOException` is caught, a new `IOException` is thrown with a custom error message and the original `IOException` as its cause.

This ensures that any I/O errors that occur while appending to the writer are properly handled and propagated up the call stack.
