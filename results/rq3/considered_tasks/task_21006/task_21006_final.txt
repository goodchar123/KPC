
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
public boolean supportsOpenStatementsAcrossCommit(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed.");
    }
    try {
        DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
        if (metaData == null) {
            throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve database metadata.");
        }
        return metaData.supportsOpenStatementsAcrossCommit();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to check if database supports open statements across commits.", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the `Connection` object. If the connection is closed, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message.

Next, the method tries to retrieve the `DatabaseMetaData` object using the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` object. If the metadata object is null, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message.

Finally, the method calls the `supportsOpenStatementsAcrossCommit()` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` object to check if the database supports keeping statements open across commits. If a `SQLException` occurs while retrieving the metadata or checking the support, it is caught and re-thrown with an appropriate message and the original exception as the cause.
