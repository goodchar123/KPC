Please write a java method that Writes a byte to the compressed output stream.
Here's an example Java method that writes a byte to a compressed output stream using the `java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream` class:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream;

public class CompressedOutputStream {
    
    private DeflaterOutputStream outputStream;
    
    public CompressedOutputStream(DeflaterOutputStream outputStream) {
        this.outputStream = outputStream;
    }
    
    public void writeByte(byte b) throws IOException {
        outputStream.write(b);
    }
    
    // Other methods for writing different data types to the compressed output stream
    
}
```

In this example, the `CompressedOutputStream` class takes a `DeflaterOutputStream` object as a constructor parameter. The `writeByte` method simply calls the `write` method of the `DeflaterOutputStream` object to write a single byte to the compressed output stream.

Please check if an I/O error has occurred for java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `writeByte` method that checks for an I/O error and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public void writeByte(byte b) throws IOException {
    try {
        outputStream.write(b);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // An I/O error occurred, so throw an IOException with the error message
        throw new IOException("Error writing byte to compressed output stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we've added a `try-catch` block around the call to `outputStream.write(b)`. If an `IOException` is thrown, we catch it and throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message that includes the original error message. This way, the caller of the `writeByte` method can handle the error appropriately.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
