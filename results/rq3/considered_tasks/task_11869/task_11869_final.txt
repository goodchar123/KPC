Sure, here's an updated version of the `writeByte` method that checks for an I/O error and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public void writeBytes(byte[] bytes) throws IOException {
    try {
        outputStream.write(bytes);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // An I/O error occurred, so throw an IOException with the error message
        throw new IOException("Error writing bytes to compressed output stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we've added a `try-catch` block around the call to `outputStream.write(bytes)`. If an `IOException` is thrown, we catch it and throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message that includes the original error message. This way, the caller of the `writeBytes` method can handle the error appropriately.
