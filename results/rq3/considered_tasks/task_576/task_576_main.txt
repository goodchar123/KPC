Please write a java method that Finds cycles of threads that are in deadlock waiting to acquire object monitors.
Here's a Java method that finds cycles of threads that are in deadlock waiting to acquire object monitors:

```java
public static void findDeadlock() {
    ThreadMXBean threadMXBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
    long[] threadIds = threadMXBean.findDeadlockedThreads();
    if (threadIds != null) {
        ThreadInfo[] threadInfos = threadMXBean.getThreadInfo(threadIds);
        System.out.println("Deadlock detected:");
        for (ThreadInfo threadInfo : threadInfos) {
            System.out.println(threadInfo.getThreadName() + " is waiting on " + threadInfo.getLockInfo().toString());
            System.out.println("    which is held by " + threadInfo.getLockOwnerName());
            for (ThreadInfo blockedThreadInfo : threadMXBean.getThreadInfo(threadInfo.getBlockedThreadIds())) {
                System.out.println("    " + blockedThreadInfo.getThreadName() + " is blocked on " + blockedThreadInfo.getLockInfo().toString());
                System.out.println("        which is held by " + blockedThreadInfo.getLockOwnerName());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This method uses the `ThreadMXBean` class to find deadlocked threads and their information. It prints out the name of the thread that is waiting on a lock, the lock it is waiting on, and the thread that is holding the lock. It also prints out the name of any threads that are blocked on the lock and the thread that is holding the lock.

Please check if a security manager         exists and the caller does not have         ManagementPermission("monitor"). for java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean.findDeadlockedThreads() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check if the Java virtual machine does not support monitoring of ownable synchronizer usage. for java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean.findDeadlockedThreads() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Here's the updated Java method that checks for security manager and Java virtual machine support before calling `ThreadMXBean.findDeadlockedThreads()`:

```java
public static void findDeadlock() throws SecurityException, UnsupportedOperationException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new ManagementPermission("monitor"));
    }
    ThreadMXBean threadMXBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
    if (!threadMXBean.isSynchronizerUsageSupported()) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Java virtual machine does not support monitoring of ownable synchronizer usage");
    }
    long[] threadIds = threadMXBean.findDeadlockedThreads();
    if (threadIds != null) {
        ThreadInfo[] threadInfos = threadMXBean.getThreadInfo(threadIds);
        System.out.println("Deadlock detected:");
        for (ThreadInfo threadInfo : threadInfos) {
            System.out.println(threadInfo.getThreadName() + " is waiting on " + threadInfo.getLockInfo().toString());
            System.out.println("    which is held by " + threadInfo.getLockOwnerName());
            for (ThreadInfo blockedThreadInfo : threadMXBean.getThreadInfo(threadInfo.getBlockedThreadIds())) {
                System.out.println("    " + blockedThreadInfo.getThreadName() + " is blocked on " + blockedThreadInfo.getLockInfo().toString());
                System.out.println("        which is held by " + blockedThreadInfo.getLockOwnerName());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists and if the caller has the `ManagementPermission("monitor")`. If not, it throws a `SecurityException`. It also checks if the Java virtual machine supports monitoring of ownable synchronizer usage. If not, it throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
