Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a ZIP file error after calling `finish()` on the `ZipOutputStream`:

```java
public static void finishZipOutputStream(ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream) throws IOException, ZipException {
    zipOutputStream.finish();
    zipOutputStream.flush();
    
    if (zipOutputStream.getFinish()) {
        throw new ZipException("ZIP file error occurred");
    }
}
```

After calling `finish()`, we check if a ZIP file error has occurred by calling `getFinish()` on the `ZipOutputStream`. If it returns `true`, we throw a `ZipException` with an appropriate error message. If no error has occurred, the method completes successfully.
