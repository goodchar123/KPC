Please write a java method that Finishes writing the contents of the ZIP output stream without closing the underlying stream.
Here's a Java method that finishes writing the contents of the ZIP output stream without closing the underlying stream:

```java
public static void finishZipOutputStream(ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream) throws IOException {
    zipOutputStream.finish();
    zipOutputStream.flush();
}
```

This method takes a `ZipOutputStream` as input and calls the `finish()` method to complete writing the contents of the ZIP output stream. It then flushes the stream to ensure that all data is written to the underlying stream. The underlying stream is not closed, so it can be used for further operations if needed.

Please check if a ZIP file error has occurred for java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.finish() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ZipException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a ZIP file error after calling `finish()` on the `ZipOutputStream`:

```java
public static void finishZipOutputStream(ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream) throws IOException, ZipException {
    zipOutputStream.finish();
    zipOutputStream.flush();
    
    if (zipOutputStream.getFinish()) {
        throw new ZipException("ZIP file error occurred");
    }
}
```

After calling `finish()`, we check if a ZIP file error has occurred by calling `getFinish()` on the `ZipOutputStream`. If it returns `true`, we throw a `ZipException` with an appropriate error message. If no error has occurred, the method completes successfully.
