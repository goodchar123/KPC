Please write a java method that Returns the int array that backs this buffer  (optional operation).
Assuming you are referring to a Java `IntBuffer` object, here is a method that returns the int array that backs the buffer:

```java
public int[] getIntBufferArray(IntBuffer buffer) {
    int[] array = new int[buffer.remaining()];
    buffer.get(array);
    buffer.rewind();
    return array;
}
```

This method takes an `IntBuffer` object as input and returns an `int` array that contains the same elements as the buffer. The `remaining()` method is used to determine the number of elements in the buffer, and a new `int` array is created with that size. The `get()` method is then used to copy the elements from the buffer into the array, and the `rewind()` method is called to reset the buffer's position to zero. Finally, the array is returned.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If there are fewer than length ints          remaining in this buffer for java.nio.IntBuffer.get(int[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw BufferUnderflowException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the remaining elements in the buffer and throws a `BufferUnderflowException` if there are fewer than `length` elements remaining:

```java
public int[] getIntBufferArray(IntBuffer buffer, int length) {
    if (buffer.remaining() < length) {
        throw new BufferUnderflowException();
    }
    int[] array = new int[length];
    buffer.get(array);
    buffer.rewind();
    return array;
}
```

This method takes an additional `length` parameter that specifies the number of elements to be copied from the buffer to the array. The method first checks if there are enough remaining elements in the buffer to copy `length` elements. If there are not enough elements, it throws a `BufferUnderflowException`. Otherwise, it creates a new `int` array of size `length`, copies the elements from the buffer to the array using the `get()` method, resets the buffer's position to zero using the `rewind()` method, and returns the array.
