
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
public boolean supportsOpenCursorsAcrossCommit(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed.");
    }
    
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    if (metaData == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve database metadata.");
    }
    
    try {
        return metaData.supportsOpenCursorsAcrossCommit();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to determine whether the database supports keeping cursors open across commits.", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `Connection` object is closed using its `isClosed()` method. If the connection is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

Next, it retrieves the `DatabaseMetaData` object for the database using the `getMetaData()` method on the `Connection` object. If the `DatabaseMetaData` object is `null`, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

Finally, it calls the `supportsOpenCursorsAcrossCommit()` method on the `DatabaseMetaData` object to determine whether the database supports keeping cursors open across commits. If a `SQLException` is thrown during this call, it is caught and re-thrown with an appropriate error message.
