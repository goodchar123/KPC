
Sure, here's an updated version of the `showMessageDialog` method that checks if `GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless` returns `true` before displaying the dialog box. If it does, a `HeadlessException` is thrown:

```java
import java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment;
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class DialogExample {
    public static void showMessageDialog() throws HeadlessException {
        if (GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()) {
            throw new HeadlessException();
        }
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "This is a message", "Message", JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
    }
}
```

The `GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless` method returns `true` if the current environment is headless, meaning that there is no display device available. If this is the case, attempting to display a dialog box would not be possible, so we throw a `HeadlessException` to indicate that the operation cannot be performed.

Note that we've added `throws HeadlessException` to the method signature to indicate that this exception may be thrown. If you call this method from another method, you'll need to handle this exception appropriately.
