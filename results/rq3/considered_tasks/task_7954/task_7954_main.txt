Please write a java method that Causes the current thread to wait until it is awakened, typically by being notified or interrupted.
Here is an example Java method that causes the current thread to wait until it is awakened:

```
public void waitForNotification() {
    synchronized(this) {
        try {
            this.wait();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // Handle the exception
        }
    }
}
```

In this method, the `synchronized` block ensures that the thread is properly synchronized with other threads that may be accessing the same object. The `wait()` method is then called on the object, causing the thread to wait until it is awakened by a call to `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on the same object. 

Note that the `wait()` method can throw an `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting. This exception should be handled appropriately in your code.

Please check if the current thread is not               the owner of this object's monitor. for java.lang.Object.notify() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
You are correct. The `notify()` method can only be called by a thread that owns the object's monitor. If the current thread is not the owner of the monitor, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` should be thrown. Here is the updated code snippet that includes this check:

```
public void notifyAndWait() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // Check if the current thread is the owner of the monitor
        if (Thread.currentThread() != Thread.holdsLock(this)) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
        }
        // Notify any waiting threads and release the monitor
        this.notify();
    }
}
```

In this updated method, we first check if the current thread is the owner of the monitor using the `Thread.holdsLock()` method. If the current thread is not the owner, we throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException`. Otherwise, we call `notify()` to wake up any waiting threads and release the monitor.
