You are correct. The `notify()` method can only be called by a thread that owns the object's monitor. If the current thread is not the owner of the monitor, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` should be thrown. Here is the updated code snippet that includes this check:

```
public void notifyAndWait() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // Check if the current thread is the owner of the monitor
        if (Thread.currentThread() != Thread.holdsLock(this)) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
        }
        // Notify any waiting threads and release the monitor
        this.notify();
    }
}
```

In this updated method, we first check if the current thread is the owner of the monitor using the `Thread.holdsLock()` method. If the current thread is not the owner, we throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException`. Otherwise, we call `notify()` to wake up any waiting threads and release the monitor.
