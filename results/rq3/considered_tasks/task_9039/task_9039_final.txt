Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the `IllegalStateException`:

```java
public static boolean containsValue(Map<?, ?> map, Object value) {
    for (Map.Entry<?, ?> entry : map.entrySet()) {
        try {
            if (Objects.equals(value, entry.getValue())) {
                return true;
            }
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            // Entry has been removed from the backing map
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch the `IllegalStateException` that may be thrown if the entry has been removed from the backing map. If this exception is caught, the method simply continues to the next entry. If a match is found, the method returns `true`. If no match is found, the method returns `false`.
