Please write a java method that Returns the offset after the last character of the subsequence captured by the given named-capturing group during the previous match operation.
Here's the Java method that returns the offset after the last character of the subsequence captured by the given named-capturing group during the previous match operation:

```java
public int end(String groupName, Matcher matcher) {
    return matcher.end(groupName);
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the name of the named-capturing group and the `Matcher` object that was used in the previous match operation. It then calls the `end` method of the `Matcher` object, passing in the name of the named-capturing group as the argument, and returns the result.

Note that if the named-capturing group was not found in the previous match operation, this method will return `-1`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If no match has yet been attempted,          or if the previous match operation failed for java.util.regex.Matcher.end(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check If there is no capturing group in the pattern          with the given name for java.util.regex.Matcher.end(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned:

```java
public int end(String groupName, Matcher matcher) {
    if (!matcher.find()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No match has yet been attempted");
    }
    int groupIndex = matcher.groupIndex(groupName);
    if (groupIndex == -1) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("No capturing group in the pattern with the given name");
    }
    return matcher.end(groupIndex);
}
```

This method first checks if a match has been attempted by calling the `find` method of the `Matcher` object. If no match has been attempted, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.

Next, it gets the index of the named-capturing group by calling the `groupIndex` method of the `Matcher` object, passing in the name of the group as the argument. If there is no capturing group in the pattern with the given name, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.

Finally, if both checks pass, it calls the `end` method of the `Matcher` object, passing in the index of the named-capturing group as the argument, and returns the result.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If no match has yet been attempted,          or if the previous match operation failed for java.util.regex.Matcher.end(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check If there is no capturing group in the pattern          with the given index for java.util.regex.Matcher.end(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned:

```java
public int end(int groupIndex, Matcher matcher) {
    if (!matcher.find()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No match has yet been attempted");
    }
    int groupCount = matcher.groupCount();
    if (groupIndex < 0 || groupIndex > groupCount) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("No capturing group in the pattern with the given index");
    }
    return matcher.end(groupIndex);
}
```

This method first checks if a match has been attempted by calling the `find` method of the `Matcher` object. If no match has been attempted, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.

Next, it gets the number of capturing groups in the pattern by calling the `groupCount` method of the `Matcher` object. If the given index is out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than the number of capturing groups), it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Finally, if both checks pass, it calls the `end` method of the `Matcher` object, passing in the index of the named-capturing group as the argument, and returns the result.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If no match has yet been attempted,          or if the previous match operation failed for java.util.regex.Matcher.end(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.

    }
    int groupCount = matcher.groupCount();
    if (groupIndex < 0 || groupIndex > groupCount) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("No capturing group in the pattern with the given index");
    }
    return matcher.end(groupIndex);
}
```

This method first checks if a match has been attempted by calling the `hitEnd` method of the `Matcher` object to see if the end of the input was reached during the previous match operation. If the end was not reached and no match was found, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.

Next, it gets the number of capturing groups in the pattern by calling the `groupCount` method of the `Matcher` object. If the given index is out of bounds (less than 0 or greater than the number of capturing groups), it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Finally, if both checks pass, it calls the `end` method of the `Matcher` object, passing in the index of the named-capturing group as the argument, and returns the result.

Then, it checks if the given capturing group was actually matched by calling the `start` method of the `Matcher` object with the given group index. If the start position is `-1`, it means that the capturing group was not matched, so it throws an `IllegalStateException`.

Finally, if all checks pass, it calls the `end` method of the `Matcher` object, passing in the index of the named-capturing group as the argument, and returns the result.
