Please write a java method that Connects this socket to the specified port on the named host.
Here's an example Java method that connects a socket to a specified port on a named host:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class SocketConnector {
    public static void connectSocket(String hostName, int portNumber) {
        try {
            // Create a new socket with the specified host name and port number
            Socket socket = new Socket(hostName, portNumber);
            
            // Do something with the socket, such as sending or receiving data
            
            // Close the socket when finished
            socket.close();
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            System.err.println("Unknown host: " + hostName);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error connecting to " + hostName + ":" + portNumber);
        }
    }
}
```

To use this method, simply call `SocketConnector.connectSocket("example.com", 80)` with the desired host name and port number. Note that this method may throw an `UnknownHostException` if the specified host name cannot be resolved, or an `IOException` if there is an error connecting to the host.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when closing this socket. for java.net.Socket.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `connectSocket` method that checks for an I/O error when closing the socket:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class SocketConnector {
    public static void connectSocket(String hostName, int portNumber) throws IOException {
        Socket socket = null;
        try {
            // Create a new socket with the specified host name and port number
            socket = new Socket(hostName, portNumber);
            
            // Do something with the socket, such as sending or receiving data
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            System.err.println("Unknown host: " + hostName);
            return;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error connecting to " + hostName + ":" + portNumber);
            return;
        } finally {
            // Close the socket and check for I/O errors
            if (socket != null) {
                try {
                    socket.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new IOException("Error closing socket: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we use a `try-catch-finally` block to ensure that the socket is always closed, even if an exception is thrown. In the `finally` block, we check for an I/O error when closing the socket and throw an `IOException` if one occurs. This allows the calling code to handle the error appropriately.
