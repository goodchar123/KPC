Please write a java method that See the general contract of the readInt method of DataInput.
Here is an example of a Java method that follows the general contract of the readInt method of DataInput:

```
/**
 * Reads the next four bytes from the input stream and returns the
 * resulting int value.
 *
 * @return the next four bytes of the input stream, interpreted as an int
 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
 */
public int readInt() throws IOException {
    int ch1 = in.read();
    int ch2 = in.read();
    int ch3 = in.read();
    int ch4 = in.read();
    if ((ch1 | ch2 | ch3 | ch4) < 0)
        throw new EOFException();
    return ((ch1 << 24) + (ch2 << 16) + (ch3 << 8) + (ch4 << 0));
}
```

This method reads the next four bytes from the input stream and returns the resulting int value. It throws an IOException if an I/O error occurs. The method follows the general contract of the readInt method of DataInput, which specifies that it reads four bytes and returns an int value.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.InputStream.read() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
You are correct. The code snippet I provided earlier does not check for an I/O error when calling `in.read()`. Here is an updated version of the method that checks for an I/O error and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```
/**
 * Reads the next four bytes from the input stream and returns the
 * resulting int value.
 *
 * @return the next four bytes of the input stream, interpreted as an int
 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs
 */
public int readInt() throws IOException {
    int ch1 = in.read();
    int ch2 = in.read();
    int ch3 = in.read();
    int ch4 = in.read();
    if ((ch1 | ch2 | ch3 | ch4) < 0) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    int result = (ch1 << 24) + (ch2 << 16) + (ch3 << 8) + ch4;
    if (result < 0) {
        throw new IOException("Invalid int value: " + result);
    }
    return result;
}
```

This updated version of the method checks for an I/O error by checking if any of the bytes read are negative. If any of the bytes are negative, an `EOFException` is thrown. Additionally, the method checks if the resulting int value is negative, and if so, throws an `IOException` with a message indicating that the int value is invalid.
