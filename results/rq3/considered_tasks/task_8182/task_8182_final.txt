I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The `clear()` method of the `List` interface is already overridden in the code snippet I provided to throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` if called. Here is the relevant code:

```
@Override
public synchronized void clear() {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("clear operation is not supported by this list");
}
```

Therefore, the implementation already checks for the condition you mentioned.
