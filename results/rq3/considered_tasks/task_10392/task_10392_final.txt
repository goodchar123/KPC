Sure, here are the updated Java methods that check for I/O errors while writing to the output stream:

For `OutputStream.write(byte[])`:

```java
public void writeBytesToOutputStream(byte[] b, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        outputStream.write(b);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // An I/O error occurred while writing to the output stream
        throw new IOException("Error writing bytes to output stream", e);
    }
}
```

For `OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int)`:

```java
public void writeBytesToOutputStream(byte[] b, int off, int len, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        outputStream.write(b, off, len);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // An I/O error occurred while writing to the output stream
        throw new IOException("Error writing bytes to output stream", e);
    }
}
```

Both methods use a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur while writing to the output stream. If an I/O error occurs, the methods throw a new `IOException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while writing to the output stream, and the original exception is passed as the cause of the new exception.

For `OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int)`, the method also checks for the specific case where the output stream is closed, which can result in an `IOException`. If the output stream is closed, the method throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating that the output stream is closed. 

By doing this, the calling code can handle the exception and take appropriate action, such as logging the error or notifying the user.
