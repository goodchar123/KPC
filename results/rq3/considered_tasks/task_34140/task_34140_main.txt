Please write a java method that Write content from a document to the given stream as plain text.
Here's a Java method that reads the content of a document and writes it to a given stream as plain text:

```java
import java.io.*;

public void writePlainText(File document, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(document));
    BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream));
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        writer.write(line);
        writer.newLine();
    }
    reader.close();
    writer.close();
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the `document` file to read from, and the `outputStream` to write to. It uses a `BufferedReader` to read the file line by line, and a `BufferedWriter` to write each line to the output stream. The `newLine()` method is used to add a newline character after each line. Finally, the method closes both the reader and writer to release any resources they were using.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.BufferedWriter.newLine() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error when calling `BufferedWriter.newLine()` and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.*;

public void writePlainText(File document, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(document));
    BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream));
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        try {
            writer.write(line);
            writer.newLine();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing line to output stream", e);
        }
    }
    reader.close();
    writer.close();
}
```

In this updated version, we've added a try-catch block around the call to `writer.newLine()`. If an `IOException` is thrown, we catch it and re-throw it as a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. This way, the caller of the method can handle the exception appropriately.

Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.BufferedReader.readLine() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.BufferedReader.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.BufferedWriter.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for I/O errors when calling `BufferedReader.readLine()`, `BufferedReader.close()`, and `BufferedWriter.close()`, and throws an `IOException` if any occur:

        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            try {
                writer.write(line);
                writer.newLine();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error writing line to output stream", e);
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error reading from input stream", e);
    } finally {
        try {
            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error closing input stream", e);
        }
        try {
            writer.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error closing output stream", e);
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we've added try-catch blocks around the calls to `reader.readLine()`, `reader.close()`, and `writer.close()`. If an `IOException` is thrown, we catch it and re-throw it as a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. We've also added a `finally` block to ensure that both the reader and writer are closed, even if an exception is thrown.
