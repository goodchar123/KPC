Please write a java method that Calculate the needs for the paragraph along the minor axis.
Here is a Java method that calculates the needs for the paragraph along the minor axis:

```
public static int calculateMinorAxisNeeds(String paragraph) {
    int needs = 0;
    String[] words = paragraph.split(" ");
    int maxWordLength = 0;
    for (String word : words) {
        if (word.length() > maxWordLength) {
            maxWordLength = word.length();
        }
    }
    needs = maxWordLength;
    return needs;
}
```

This method takes a `String` parameter `paragraph` and returns an `int` value representing the needs for the paragraph along the minor axis. 

The method first splits the paragraph into an array of words using the `split()` method with a space delimiter. It then iterates through the array of words to find the length of the longest word, which represents the maximum width needed for the paragraph along the minor axis. 

Finally, the method sets the `needs` variable to the value of `maxWordLength` and returns it.

Please check if the regular expression's syntax is invalid for java.lang.String.split(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw PatternSyntaxException.
Sure, here's the updated code that checks for invalid regular expression syntax and throws a `PatternSyntaxException` if necessary:

```
import java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException;

public static int calculateMinorAxisNeeds(String paragraph) throws PatternSyntaxException {
    int needs = 0;
    String[] words = null;
    try {
        words = paragraph.split(" ");
    } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
        throw e;
    }
    int maxWordLength = 0;
    for (String word : words) {
        if (word.length() > maxWordLength) {
            maxWordLength = word.length();
        }
    }
    needs = maxWordLength;
    return needs;
}
```

This updated method now includes a `try-catch` block that attempts to split the `paragraph` string using a space delimiter. If the regular expression syntax is invalid, a `PatternSyntaxException` is thrown and propagated up to the calling method.

Note that this method now includes a `throws` clause in the method signature to indicate that it may throw a `PatternSyntaxException`.
