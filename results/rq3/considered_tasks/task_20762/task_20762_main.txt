Please write a java method that Retrieves the current result as a ResultSet object.
Here's an example Java method that retrieves the current result as a ResultSet object:

```java
public ResultSet getCurrentResult() throws SQLException {
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.getResultSet();
    return resultSet;
}
```

This method assumes that you have a `connection` object that represents a connection to your database. It creates a new `Statement` object from the connection, which is used to execute the query and retrieve the result set. Finally, it returns the result set to the caller. Note that this method may throw a `SQLException` if there is an error executing the query or retrieving the result set.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.getResultSet() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a database access error or a closed statement before returning the result set:

```java
public ResultSet getCurrentResult() throws SQLException {
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.getResultSet();
    if (resultSet == null) {
        throw new SQLException("No result set available");
    } else if (statement.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed");
    }
    return resultSet;
}
```

This version of the method first checks if the `ResultSet` object is null, which indicates that there is no result set available. If this is the case, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

Next, it checks if the `Statement` object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the statement is closed, it throws another `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

If neither of these conditions are true, the method returns the `ResultSet` object as before.

Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.createStatement() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.getResultSet() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.Statement.isClosed() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for database access errors and closed connections/statements:

```java
public ResultSet getCurrentResult() throws SQLException {
    if (connection.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.getResultSet();
    if (resultSet == null) {
        throw new SQLException("No result set available");
    } else if (statement.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed");
    } else if (statement.getConnection().isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    return resultSet;
}
```

This version of the method first checks if the `Connection` object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the connection is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

Next, it creates a new `Statement` object from the connection and retrieves the `ResultSet` object as before. It then checks if the `ResultSet` object is null and if the `Statement` object is closed, throwing `SQLExceptions` with appropriate error messages if either of these conditions are true.

Finally, it checks if the `Connection` object associated with the `Statement` object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the connection is closed, it throws another `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

If none of these conditions are true, the method returns the `ResultSet` object as before.

    } else if (statement.isClosed()) {
