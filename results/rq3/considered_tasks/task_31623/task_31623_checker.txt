------------------------------------------------------
Is the EOFException handled or caught for java.io.DataInputStream.readDouble() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `EOFException` is not handled or caught explicitly for `java.io.DataInputStream.readDouble()` in the code snippet. However, the method checks for the availability of bytes in the stream before attempting to read a double, and if there are not enough bytes available, it throws an `EOFException` with an appropriate message.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.DataInputStream.readDouble() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is not handled or caught explicitly for `java.io.DataInputStream.readDouble()` in the code snippet. However, the method throws an `IOException` with an appropriate message if the input stream has more data than expected or if the stream has been closed or an I/O error occurred after reading all the doubles.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.DataInputStream.readFully(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught explicitly for `java.io.DataInputStream.readFully(byte[])` in the code snippet. However, the method checks for null input stream and array of doubles and throws a `NullPointerException` with an appropriate message if either of them is null.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the EOFException handled or caught for java.io.DataInputStream.readFully(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `EOFException` is not handled or caught explicitly for `java.io.DataInputStream.readFully(byte[])` in the code snippet. However, the method checks for the availability of bytes in the stream before attempting to read a byte array, and if there are not enough bytes available, it throws an `EOFException` with an appropriate message.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.DataInputStream.readFully(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is not handled or caught explicitly for `java.io.DataInputStream.readFully(byte[])` in the code snippet. However, the method throws an `IOException` with an appropriate message if the input stream has more data than expected or if the stream has been closed or an I/O error occurred after reading all the doubles.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the EOFException handled or caught for java.io.DataInputStream.readByte() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `EOFException` is caught and handled explicitly for `java.io.DataInputStream.readByte()` in the code snippet. The method attempts to read one more byte using the `readByte()` method of the `DataInputStream`, and if an `EOFException` is thrown, it means that the stream has been closed, so the method proceeds to the next check.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.DataInputStream.readByte() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled explicitly for `java.io.DataInputStream.readByte()` in the code snippet. The method attempts to read one more byte using the `readByte()` method of the `DataInputStream`, and if any other exception is thrown, it means that the stream has not been closed, so an `IOException` is thrown with an appropriate message.
