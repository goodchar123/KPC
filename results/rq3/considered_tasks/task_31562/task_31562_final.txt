
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for an I/O error when writing to the stream using `OutputStream.write(byte[])`:

```java
public void writeBytesToStream(byte[] bytes, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        outputStream.write(bytes);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // An I/O error occurred, so throw an IOException
        throw new IOException("Error writing bytes to stream", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur when writing to the stream. If an `IOException` is caught, the method throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while writing to the stream. The original `IOException` that was caught is passed as the cause of the new `IOException`, so that the caller can see the original error message and stack trace.
