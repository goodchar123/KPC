Please write a java method that Reads exactly len bytes from this file into the byte array, starting at the current file pointer.
Here's a Java method that reads exactly `len` bytes from a file into a byte array, starting at the current file pointer:

```java
public static byte[] readBytesFromFile(File file, int len) throws IOException {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[len];
    try (RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, "r")) {
        raf.readFully(buffer);
    }
    return buffer;
}
```

This method takes a `File` object and an integer `len` as input parameters. It creates a byte array of size `len` to hold the bytes read from the file. It then creates a `RandomAccessFile` object with the file and "r" (read) mode. The `readFully` method of the `RandomAccessFile` class is used to read exactly `len` bytes from the file into the byte array. Finally, the method returns the byte array. 

Note that this method throws an `IOException` if there is an error reading from the file.

Please check if b is null. for java.io.RandomAccessFile.readFully(byte[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if this file reaches the end before reading              all the bytes. for java.io.RandomAccessFile.readFully(byte[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw EOFException.
You're right, it's important to check for `null` and `EOF` exceptions when using `RandomAccessFile.readFully(byte[])`. Here's an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```java
public static byte[] readBytesFromFile(File file, int len) throws IOException {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[len];
    try (RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, "r")) {
        int bytesRead = raf.read(buffer);
        if (bytesRead < len) {
            throw new EOFException("End of file reached before all bytes were read");
        }
    }
    if (buffer == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Byte array is null");
    }
    return buffer;
}
```

This updated method first reads `len` bytes from the file into the byte array using `RandomAccessFile.read(byte[])`. It then checks the number of bytes actually read and throws an `EOFException` if the end of the file is reached before all bytes are read.

Next, the method checks if the byte array is `null` and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. Finally, the method returns the byte array.

Note that this method still throws an `IOException` if there is an error reading from the file.
