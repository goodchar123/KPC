Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for an I/O error when writing to the output stream:

```java
public void writeBytesToOutputStream(OutputStream outputStream, byte[] b) throws IOException {
    try {
        outputStream.write(b);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // An I/O error occurred, so throw an IOException with the error message
        throw new IOException("Error writing bytes to output stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method is similar to the previous one, but it now wraps the `outputStream.write(b)` call in a try-catch block. If an `IOException` is thrown during the write operation, the catch block catches it and throws a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message that includes the original error message.

By doing this, the calling code can handle the `IOException` in a more meaningful way, since it will have access to the specific error message that caused the exception.
