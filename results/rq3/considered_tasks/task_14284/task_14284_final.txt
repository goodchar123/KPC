Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error when calling `append(char)` on the `Appendable` object and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```
public static void appendHexByte(Appendable appendable, byte b) throws IOException {
    try {
        appendable.append(Character.forDigit((b >> 4) & 0xF, 16));
        appendable.append(Character.forDigit(b & 0xF, 16));
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error appending to Appendable object", e);
    }
}
```

This method now wraps the calls to `append(char)` in a try-catch block that catches any `IOException` that may be thrown. If an `IOException` is caught, the method throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while appending to the `Appendable` object, and includes the original `IOException` as the cause.
