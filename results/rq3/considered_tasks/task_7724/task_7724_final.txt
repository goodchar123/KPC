You're right, it's important to check if the offset is valid before inserting the subsequence. Here's an updated version of the method that includes the check and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if the offset is invalid:

```
public static void insertSubsequence(CharSequence subsequence, int startIndex, StringBuilder sequence) {
    if (startIndex < 0 || startIndex > sequence.length()) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Invalid offset: " + startIndex);
    }
    sequence.insert(startIndex, subsequence);
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `startIndex` is less than zero or greater than the length of the `sequence`. If it is, then it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` with a message indicating the invalid offset.

If the offset is valid, the method uses the `insert()` method of the StringBuilder class to insert the subsequence into the sequence at the specified index.
