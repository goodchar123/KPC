Please write a java method that Adds a node using its namespaceURI and localName.
Here's an example Java method that adds a node using its namespaceURI and localName:

```java
public static void addNode(Document doc, String namespaceURI, String localName) {
    Element element = doc.createElementNS(namespaceURI, localName);
    doc.appendChild(element);
}
```

This method takes in a `Document` object, which represents the XML document that you want to add a node to. It also takes in the `namespaceURI` and `localName` of the node that you want to add.

The method creates a new `Element` object using the `createElementNS` method of the `Document` object. This method takes in the `namespaceURI` and `localName` of the new element.

Finally, the method appends the new element to the end of the document using the `appendChild` method of the `Document` object.

Please check INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified   qualifiedName is not an XML name according to the XML   version in use specified in the Document.xmlVersion   attribute.   NAMESPACE_ERR: Raised if the qualifiedName is a   malformed qualified name, if the qualifiedName has a   prefix and the namespaceURI is null, or   if the qualifiedName has a prefix that is "xml" and   the namespaceURI is different from "   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace" [XML Namespaces]   , or if the qualifiedName or its prefix is "xmlns" and   the namespaceURI is different from "http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/", or if the namespaceURI is "http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/" and neither the qualifiedName nor its prefix is "xmlns".   NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: Always thrown if the current document does not   support the "XML" feature, since namespaces were   defined by XML. for org.w3c.dom.Document.createElementNS(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DOMException.
Please check HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if this node is of a type that does not   allow children of the type of the newChild node, or if   the node to append is one of this node's ancestors or this node   itself, or if this node is of type Document and the   DOM application attempts to append a second   DocumentType or Element node.   WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR: Raised if newChild was created   from a different document than the one that created this node.   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly or   if the previous parent of the node being inserted is readonly.   NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR: if the newChild node is a child   of the Document node, this exception might be raised   if the DOM implementation doesn't support the removal of the   DocumentType child or Element child. for org.w3c.dom.Node.appendChild(org.w3c.dom.Node) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DOMException.
Certainly! Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes error checking and throws the appropriate `DOMException`:

```java
public static void addNode(Document doc, String namespaceURI, String localName) throws DOMException {
    try {
        Element element = doc.createElementNS(namespaceURI, localName);
        doc.appendChild(element);
    } catch (DOMException e) {
        if (e.code == DOMException.INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR || e.code == DOMException.NAMESPACE_ERR) {
            throw e;
        } else {
            throw new DOMException(DOMException.HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR, "Cannot append child node");
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method still takes in a `Document` object, `namespaceURI`, and `localName`. It now includes a `try-catch` block to catch any `DOMException` that may be thrown by the `createElementNS` method.

If the `DOMException` is due to an invalid character or namespace, the method simply re-throws the exception.

If the `DOMException` is due to a hierarchy request error (e.g. trying to append a node to a node that doesn't allow children of that type), the method throws a new `DOMException` with the appropriate error code and message.

If the `DOMException` is due to any other reason, the method throws a new `DOMException` with the hierarchy request error code and a generic error message.
