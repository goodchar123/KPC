Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the checks you requested:

```java
public static int updateCipher(Cipher cipher, byte[] input, int inputOffset, int inputLen, byte[] output, int outputOffset) throws IllegalStateException, ShortBufferException {
    if (cipher == null || cipher.getOutputSize(inputLen) == 0) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cipher is in a wrong state or has not been initialized");
    }
    if (output.length - outputOffset < cipher.getOutputSize(inputLen)) {
        throw new ShortBufferException("Output buffer is too small to hold the result");
    }
    if (cipher.getOutputSize(inputLen) == 0) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cipher is in a wrong state or has not yet been initialized");
    }
    return cipher.update(input, inputOffset, inputLen, output, outputOffset);
}
```

This updated method includes the following checks:

- It checks if the cipher is in a wrong state or has not been initialized, and throws an `IllegalStateException` if this is the case.
- It checks if the given output buffer is too small to hold the result, and throws a `ShortBufferException` if this is the case.
- It checks if the cipher is in a wrong state or has not yet been initialized for the `getOutputSize()` method, and throws an `IllegalStateException` if this is the case.

Note that this method assumes that the cipher is using the default transformation (i.e., no specific algorithm or mode has been set). If you are using a different transformation, you may need to modify the checks accordingly.
