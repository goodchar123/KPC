Please write a java method that Returns true if the next token in this scanner's input can be interpreted as an int value in the specified radix using the nextInt() method.
Here's the Java method that returns true if the next token in the scanner's input can be interpreted as an int value in the specified radix using the nextInt() method:

```java
public static boolean hasNextIntInRadix(Scanner scanner, int radix) {
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        return false;
    }
    String nextToken = scanner.next();
    try {
        scanner.nextInt(radix);
        return true;
    } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
        return false;
    } finally {
        scanner.useDelimiter("\\p{javaWhitespace}+");
        scanner.skip("\\p{javaWhitespace}*");
        scanner.match();
        scanner.pushback();
        scanner.useDelimiter("\\p{javaWhitespace}+");
    }
}
```

This method takes a Scanner object and an int radix as parameters. It first checks if the scanner has a next token. If not, it returns false. If there is a next token, it reads the token as a String and tries to parse it as an int using the nextInt(radix) method. If the parsing succeeds, it returns true. If the parsing fails, it catches the InputMismatchException and returns false. Finally, it resets the scanner's delimiter, skips any whitespace characters, matches the next token, pushes it back onto the scanner, and resets the delimiter again to its original value. This ensures that the scanner is in the same state as before the method was called.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNext() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if no more tokens are available for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check If no match result is available for java.util.Scanner.match() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static boolean hasNextIntInRadix(Scanner scanner, int radix) {
    if (scanner == null || scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No more tokens available");
    }
    String nextToken = scanner.next();
    try {
        scanner.nextInt(radix);
        return true;
    } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    } finally {
        if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
        }
        if (scanner.match() == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No match result available");
        }
        scanner.useDelimiter("\\p{javaWhitespace}+");
        scanner.skip("\\p{javaWhitespace}*");
        scanner.match();
        scanner.pushback();
        scanner.useDelimiter("\\p{javaWhitespace}+");
    }
}
```

This method now checks if the scanner is closed or has an IOException before performing any operations on it. If it is closed or has an IOException, it throws an IllegalStateException with an appropriate message.

It also checks if there are no more tokens available before reading the next token. If there are no more tokens available, it throws a NoSuchElementException with an appropriate message.

If the parsing of the token as an int fails, it now throws an IllegalStateException with an appropriate message.

Finally, it checks if there is a match result available before performing any operations on it. If there is no match result available, it throws an IllegalStateException with an appropriate message.
