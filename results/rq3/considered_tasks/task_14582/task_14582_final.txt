Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static boolean hasNextIntInRadix(Scanner scanner, int radix) {
    if (scanner == null || scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No more tokens available");
    }
    String nextToken = scanner.next();
    try {
        scanner.nextInt(radix);
        return true;
    } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    } finally {
        if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
        }
        if (scanner.match() == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No match result available");
        }
        scanner.useDelimiter("\\p{javaWhitespace}+");
        scanner.skip("\\p{javaWhitespace}*");
        scanner.match();
        scanner.pushback();
        scanner.useDelimiter("\\p{javaWhitespace}+");
    }
}
```

This method now checks if the scanner is closed or has an IOException before performing any operations on it. If it is closed or has an IOException, it throws an IllegalStateException with an appropriate message.

It also checks if there are no more tokens available before reading the next token. If there are no more tokens available, it throws a NoSuchElementException with an appropriate message.

If the parsing of the token as an int fails, it now throws an IllegalStateException with an appropriate message.

Finally, it checks if there is a match result available before performing any operations on it. If there is no match result available, it throws an IllegalStateException with an appropriate message.
