Please write a java method that Clears this provider so that it no longer contains the properties used to look up facilities implemented by the provider.
Here's a Java method that clears a provider of its properties used to look up facilities implemented by the provider:

```java
public void clearProvider(Provider provider) {
    provider.clear();
}
```

This method takes in a `Provider` object as a parameter and calls its `clear()` method to remove all the properties used to look up facilities implemented by the provider.

Please check if a security manager exists and its SecurityManager.checkSecurityAccess(java.lang.String) method          denies access to clear this provider for java.security.Provider.clear() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the existence of a security manager and calls its `checkSecurityAccess()` method to determine if access to clear the provider is allowed:

```java
public void clearProvider(Provider provider) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkSecurityAccess("java.security.Provider.clear");
    }
    provider.clear();
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager exists by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, it calls its `checkSecurityAccess()` method with the string `"java.security.Provider.clear"` as the argument to determine if access to clear the provider is allowed. If access is denied, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If no security manager is present or access is allowed, the provider is cleared by calling its `clear()` method.
