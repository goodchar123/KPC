Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Here's an updated version of the `shutdown` method that includes the requested check and exception:

```java
public void shutdown() {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        try {
            sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("Caller is not permitted to modify threads", e);
        }
    }
    executor.shutdown();
}
```

Now, when calling the `shutdown` method, a `SecurityException` will be thrown if a security manager exists and the caller is not permitted to modify threads. The exception message will indicate that the caller is not permitted to modify threads.
