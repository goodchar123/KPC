Please write a java method that Updates the designated column with a binary stream value, which will have the specified number of bytes.
Here's an example Java method that updates a designated column with a binary stream value:

```java
public void updateBinaryStream(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, InputStream binaryStream, int length, int id) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setBinaryStream(1, binaryStream, length);
        pstmt.setInt(2, id);
        pstmt.executeUpdate();
    }
}
```

This method takes in a `Connection` object, the name of the table, the name of the column to update, a binary stream `InputStream`, the length of the binary stream, and the ID of the row to update. It then constructs an SQL statement to update the designated column with the binary stream value.

The `PreparedStatement` object is used to set the binary stream value using the `setBinaryStream()` method, passing in the index of the parameter, the binary stream `InputStream`, and the length of the binary stream. The ID of the row to update is also set using the `setInt()` method.

Finally, the `executeUpdate()` method is called on the `PreparedStatement` object to execute the SQL statement and update the row in the database.

Please check when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the setQueryTimeout method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running Statement for java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLTimeoutException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the currently running statement:

```java
public void updateBinaryStream(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, InputStream binaryStream, int length, int id, int timeout) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setBinaryStream(1, binaryStream, length);
        pstmt.setInt(2, id);
        pstmt.setQueryTimeout(timeout); // set query timeout
        int updateCount = pstmt.executeUpdate();
        if (updateCount == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("No rows were updated.");
        }
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        // attempt to cancel the currently running statement
        pstmt.cancel();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `timeout` which specifies the query timeout in seconds. The `setQueryTimeout()` method is called on the `PreparedStatement` object to set the query timeout.

After executing the update statement, the method checks the update count to ensure that at least one row was updated. If no rows were updated, a `SQLException` is thrown.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is caught, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel()` method on the `PreparedStatement` object. The exception is then re-thrown to indicate that the query timeout was exceeded.
