
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the currently running statement:

```java
public void updateBinaryStream(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, InputStream binaryStream, int length, int id, int timeout) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setBinaryStream(1, binaryStream, length);
        pstmt.setInt(2, id);
        pstmt.setQueryTimeout(timeout); // set query timeout
        int updateCount = pstmt.executeUpdate();
        if (updateCount == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("No rows were updated.");
        }
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        // attempt to cancel the currently running statement
        pstmt.cancel();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `timeout` which specifies the query timeout in seconds. The `setQueryTimeout()` method is called on the `PreparedStatement` object to set the query timeout.

After executing the update statement, the method checks the update count to ensure that at least one row was updated. If no rows were updated, a `SQLException` is thrown.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is caught, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel()` method on the `PreparedStatement` object. The exception is then re-thrown to indicate that the query timeout was exceeded.
