Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the two exceptions you mentioned:

```
public void removeNotificationListener(RequiredModelMBean mbean, NotificationListener listener) throws InstanceNotFoundException, ListenerNotFoundException {
    ObjectName mbeanName = mbean.getObjectName();
    MBeanServer mbeanServer = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
    try {
        mbeanServer.removeNotificationListener(mbeanName, listener);
    } catch (InstanceNotFoundException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (ListenerNotFoundException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This method now catches the InstanceNotFoundException and ListenerNotFoundException exceptions thrown by the removeNotificationListener method and re-throws them. This allows the calling code to handle these exceptions appropriately.

Note that this method no longer throws a generic Exception, as it's better practice to be more specific about the exceptions that a method can throw.
