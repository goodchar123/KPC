Here's the updated Java method that checks for I/O errors when calling `append()` and `close()` methods:

```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public void writeCharSequenceToFile(CharSequence charSequence, String filePath) throws IOException {
    BufferedWriter writer = null;
    try {
        writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath));
        writer.append(charSequence);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error writing to file: " + filePath, e);
    } finally {
        if (writer != null) {
            try {
                writer.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error closing file: " + filePath, e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch-finally block to handle I/O errors. If an error occurs when calling `append()`, an IOException is thrown with a message indicating the file path and the original exception. Similarly, if an error occurs when calling `close()`, an IOException is thrown with a message indicating the file path and the original exception. The `finally` block ensures that the writer is closed even if an exception is thrown.
