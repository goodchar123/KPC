List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
The Java JDK methods used in the method above are:

- `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)`: Reads up to `byteArray.length - bytesRead` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. The method returns the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or `-1` if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached.
- `java.io.IOException`: Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred. This class is the general class of exceptions produced by failed or interrupted I/O operations.

------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is declared in the method signature with the `throws` keyword, which means that any `IOException` thrown by the `read` method will be propagated up the call stack to the method's caller to be handled or caught there.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. Instead, it is thrown explicitly by the method if the `byteArray` parameter is `null`. It is up to the method's caller to handle or catch this exception if necessary.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. Instead, it is thrown explicitly by the method if the `offset` parameter is negative or greater than the length of `byteArray`. It is up to the method's caller to handle or catch this exception if necessary.

------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `readBytes` method, but it is not caught or handled within the method itself.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is thrown explicitly by the `readBytes` method, but it is not caught or handled within the method itself.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.

------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is handled or caught in the code snippet using the `throws` keyword in the method signature. This means that any `IOException` thrown by the `read` method will be propagated up the call stack to the method's caller, which is responsible for handling or catching the exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. Instead, the method explicitly throws a `NullPointerException` with a message indicating that `byteArray` is `null` if the `byteArray` parameter is `null`. This means that the exception will be propagated up the call stack to the method's caller, which is responsible for handling or catching the exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. Instead, the method explicitly throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` with a message indicating that `offset` is negative or greater than the length of `byteArray` if the `offset` parameter is negative or greater than the length of `byteArray`. This means that the exception will be propagated up the call stack to the method's caller, which is responsible for handling or catching the exception.

------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is thrown by the `read` method of `InputStream` and is declared to be thrown by the `readBytes` method. Therefore, it is handled or caught by the caller of the `readBytes` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `NullPointerException` is explicitly checked for in the `readBytes` method and is thrown with a message indicating that `byteArray` is `null`. Therefore, it is handled or caught by the caller of the `readBytes` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is explicitly checked for in the `readBytes` method and is thrown with a message indicating that `offset` or `len` is invalid. Therefore, it is handled or caught by the caller of the `readBytes` method.
