Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if a match has been attempted or if the previous match operation failed before calling `group()`, and throws an `IllegalStateException` if either of these conditions are true:

```java
public static String findNextOccurrence(String input, String pattern) {
    Pattern p = Pattern.compile(pattern);
    Matcher m = p.matcher(input);
    if (m.find()) {
        try {
            return m.group();
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Previous match operation failed", e);
        }
    } else {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No match found");
    }
}
```

This method first compiles the pattern using `Pattern.compile()`, and then creates a `Matcher` object using the input string and the compiled pattern.

The `find()` method is called to attempt to find the next occurrence of the pattern in the input string. If a match is found, the `group()` method is called to return the matched string. We wrap this call in a try-catch block to catch any `IllegalStateException` that may be thrown if the previous match operation failed.

If no match is found, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown with an appropriate error message. If the previous match operation failed, we throw another `IllegalStateException` with an appropriate error message and pass the original exception as the cause.
