Please write a java method that Returns the sample in a specified band for a pixel located at (x,y) as a double.
Here's a Java method that returns the sample in a specified band for a pixel located at (x,y) as a double:

```java
public double getSample(int x, int y, int band) {
    // Assuming you have a BufferedImage object called "image"
    Raster raster = image.getData();
    double sample = raster.getSampleDouble(x, y, band);
    return sample;
}
```

This method takes in three parameters: the x and y coordinates of the pixel you want to get the sample for, and the band number you want to retrieve the sample from. It then gets the Raster object from the BufferedImage, and uses the `getSampleDouble()` method to retrieve the sample value as a double. Finally, it returns the sample value.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the coordinates or the band index are not in bounds. for java.awt.image.Raster.getSampleDouble(int,int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the coordinates or the band index are not in bounds for `java.awt.image.Raster.getSampleDouble(int,int,int)`, and throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if they are out of bounds:

```java
public double getSample(int x, int y, int band) {
    // Assuming you have a BufferedImage object called "image"
    Raster raster = image.getData();
    int numBands = raster.getNumBands();
    if (x < 0 || x >= raster.getWidth() || y < 0 || y >= raster.getHeight() || band < 0 || band >= numBands) {
        throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Coordinates or band index out of bounds");
    }
    double sample = raster.getSampleDouble(x, y, band);
    return sample;
}
```

This updated method first gets the number of bands in the Raster object using the `getNumBands()` method. It then checks if the x and y coordinates are within the bounds of the Raster object's width and height, respectively, and if the band index is within the bounds of the number of bands. If any of these conditions are not met, it throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` with a message indicating which index is out of bounds. If all indices are within bounds, it retrieves the sample value using `getSampleDouble()` and returns it.
