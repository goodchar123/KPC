Please write a java method that Obtains a ThaiBuddhistDate representing a date in the Thai Buddhist calendar system from the proleptic-year, month-of-year and day-of-month fields.
Sure, here's a Java method that obtains a ThaiBuddhistDate representing a date in the Thai Buddhist calendar system from the proleptic-year, month-of-year and day-of-month fields:

```
public static ThaiBuddhistDate getThaiBuddhistDate(int year, int month, int day) {
    return ThaiBuddhistDate.of(year, month, day);
}
```

This method takes in three parameters: `year`, `month`, and `day`, which represent the proleptic-year, month-of-year, and day-of-month fields, respectively. It then uses the `ThaiBuddhistDate.of()` method to create a new `ThaiBuddhistDate` object with the specified year, month, and day values.

You can call this method like this:

```
ThaiBuddhistDate thaiDate = getThaiBuddhistDate(2564, 10, 1);
```

This will create a `ThaiBuddhistDate` object representing October 1, 2021 in the Thai Buddhist calendar system.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the value of any field is out of range,  or if the day of month is invalid for the month year for java.time.chrono.ThaiBuddhistDate.of(int,int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
You're right, it's important to check if the values of the fields are valid before creating a `ThaiBuddhistDate` object. Here's an updated version of the method that checks for invalid values and throws a `DateTimeException` if any of the fields are out of range or if the day of month is invalid for the month year:

```
public static ThaiBuddhistDate getThaiBuddhistDate(int year, int month, int day) {
    try {
        return ThaiBuddhistDate.of(year, month, day);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid date values: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `DateTimeException` that may be thrown by the `ThaiBuddhistDate.of()` method. If an exception is caught, it throws a new `DateTimeException` with a custom error message that includes the original exception's message.

You can call this method like this:

```
ThaiBuddhistDate thaiDate = getThaiBuddhistDate(2564, 10, 1);
```

If any of the values are out of range or if the day of month is invalid for the month year, a `DateTimeException` will be thrown with an appropriate error message.
