
You can modify the code snippet I provided earlier to check for I/O errors and throw an `IOException` if necessary. Here's the updated code:

```java
public void writeDateAttribute(DataOutputStream out, java.sql.Date date) throws IOException {
    try {
        out.writeByte(1); // attribute type for Date
        out.writeLong(date.getTime()); // write the date as a long value representing milliseconds since January 1, 1970
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // If an I/O error occurs, re-throw it as an IOException
        throw new IOException("Error writing date attribute to stream", e);
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we've added a try-catch block around the calls to `writeByte` and `writeLong`. If an I/O error occurs, the catch block will catch the exception and re-throw it as an `IOException`, with a more descriptive error message.
