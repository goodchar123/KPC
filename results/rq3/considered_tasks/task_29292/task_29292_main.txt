Please write a java method that Writes content from a document to the given stream as plain text.
Here's a Java method that writes content from a document to the given stream as plain text:

```java
import java.io.*;
import org.apache.poi.xwpf.usermodel.*;

public void writePlainText(XWPFDocument document, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
    // Create a new plain text writer
    OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(out, "UTF-8");

    // Loop through all paragraphs in the document
    for (XWPFParagraph paragraph : document.getParagraphs()) {
        // Write the text content of the paragraph to the writer
        writer.write(paragraph.getText());
        writer.write("\n"); // Add a newline character after each paragraph
    }

    // Close the writer and the output stream
    writer.close();
    out.close();
}
```

This method takes in an `XWPFDocument` object representing the document to be written, and an `OutputStream` object representing the stream to write to. It loops through all paragraphs in the document, writes the text content of each paragraph to the writer, and adds a newline character after each paragraph. Finally, it closes the writer and the output stream.

Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.Writer.write(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.*;
import org.apache.poi.xwpf.usermodel.*;

public void writePlainText(XWPFDocument document, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
    // Create a new plain text writer
    OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(out, "UTF-8");

    // Loop through all paragraphs in the document
    for (XWPFParagraph paragraph : document.getParagraphs()) {
        // Write the text content of the paragraph to the writer
        try {
            writer.write(paragraph.getText());
            writer.write("\n"); // Add a newline character after each paragraph
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // If an I/O error occurs, close the writer and the output stream and throw an IOException
            writer.close();
            out.close();
            throw new IOException("Error writing plain text: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    // Close the writer and the output stream
    writer.close();
    out.close();
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur when writing to the writer. If an I/O error occurs, it closes the writer and the output stream and throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating the error.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If off is negative, or len is negative,          or off + len is negative or greater than the length          of the given array for java.io.OutputStreamWriter.write(char[],int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of them are true:

```java
import java.io.*;
import org.apache.poi.xwpf.usermodel.*;

public void writePlainText(XWPFDocument document, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
    // Create a new plain text writer
    OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(out, "UTF-8");

    // Loop through all paragraphs in the document
    for (XWPFParagraph paragraph : document.getParagraphs()) {
        // Write the text content of the paragraph to the writer
        char[] text = paragraph.getText().toCharArray();
        int off = 0;
        int len = text.length;
        try {
            if (off < 0 || len < 0 || off + len < 0 || off + len > text.length) {
                throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Invalid offset or length");
            }
            writer.write(text, off, len);
            writer.write("\n"); // Add a newline character after each paragraph
        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            // If an index out of bounds error occurs, close the writer and the output stream and throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException
            writer.close();
            out.close();
            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Error writing plain text: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // If an I/O error occurs, close the writer and the output stream and throw an IOException
            writer.close();
            out.close();
            throw new IOException("Error writing plain text: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    // Close the writer and the output stream
    writer.close();
    out.close();
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch any `IndexOutOfBoundsException` or `IOException` that may occur when writing to the writer. Before writing to the writer, it checks if the offset and length values are valid. If any of the conditions you mentioned are true, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` with a message indicating the error. If an I/O error occurs, it throws an `IOException` with a message indicating the error. If no errors occur, it closes the writer and the output stream.
