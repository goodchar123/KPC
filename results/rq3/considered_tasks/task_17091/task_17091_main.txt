Please write a java method that Creates a CachedRowSet object that is an empty copy of this CachedRowSet object.
Here's a Java method that creates a CachedRowSet object that is an empty copy of an existing CachedRowSet object:

```java
public CachedRowSet createEmptyCopy(CachedRowSet original) throws SQLException {
    CachedRowSet copy = (CachedRowSet) original.createCopy();
    copy.setCommand("");
    copy.execute();
    copy.beforeFirst();
    return copy;
}
```

This method takes in a CachedRowSet object called `original` and returns a new CachedRowSet object that is an empty copy of the original. 

First, we create a copy of the original CachedRowSet using the `createCopy()` method. This creates a new CachedRowSet object that has the same properties and data as the original.

Next, we set the command of the copy to an empty string using the `setCommand()` method. This clears the SQL command associated with the CachedRowSet, effectively making it an empty result set.

We then execute the copy using the `execute()` method and move the cursor to the beginning of the result set using the `beforeFirst()` method.

Finally, we return the copy, which is now an empty CachedRowSet object.

Please check if an error occurs in generating the copy of the of this CachedRowSet object for javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet.createCopy() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for errors in generating the copy of the CachedRowSet object using `createCopy()` method and throws a `SQLException` if an error occurs:

```java
public CachedRowSet createEmptyCopy(CachedRowSet original) throws SQLException {
    CachedRowSet copy = null;
    try {
        copy = (CachedRowSet) original.createCopy();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error creating copy of CachedRowSet object", e);
    }
    copy.setCommand("");
    copy.execute();
    copy.beforeFirst();
    return copy;
}
```

In this updated method, we first initialize the `copy` variable to `null`. Then, we try to create a copy of the original CachedRowSet using the `createCopy()` method inside a try-catch block.

If an error occurs during the copy creation process, a `SQLException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the original exception.

If the copy is successfully created, we proceed with setting the command of the copy to an empty string, executing it, and moving the cursor to the beginning of the result set, as before.

Finally, we return the copy, which is now an empty CachedRowSet object.
