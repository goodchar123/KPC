Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for errors in generating the copy of the CachedRowSet object using `createCopy()` method and throws a `SQLException` if an error occurs:

```java
public CachedRowSet createEmptyCopy(CachedRowSet original) throws SQLException {
    CachedRowSet copy = null;
    try {
        copy = (CachedRowSet) original.createCopy();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error creating copy of CachedRowSet object", e);
    }
    copy.setCommand("");
    copy.execute();
    copy.beforeFirst();
    return copy;
}
```

In this updated method, we first initialize the `copy` variable to `null`. Then, we try to create a copy of the original CachedRowSet using the `createCopy()` method inside a try-catch block.

If an error occurs during the copy creation process, a `SQLException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the original exception.

If the copy is successfully created, we proceed with setting the command of the copy to an empty string, executing it, and moving the cursor to the beginning of the result set, as before.

Finally, we return the copy, which is now an empty CachedRowSet object.
