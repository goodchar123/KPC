Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for a failure in the underlying synchronization provider's writer and throws a `SyncProviderException` if necessary:

```java
public void propagateChanges(CachedRowSet cachedRowSet, Connection connection) throws SQLException, SyncProviderException {
    try {
        cachedRowSet.acceptChanges(connection);
    } catch (SyncProviderException e) {
        // If the underlying synchronization provider's writer fails to write the updates back to the data source,
        // throw a SyncProviderException with the original exception as the cause
        throw new SyncProviderException("Failed to write updates back to data source", e);
    }
}
```

In this updated method, the `acceptChanges()` method is called as before, but now it is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches any `SyncProviderException` that may be thrown. If such an exception is caught, a new `SyncProviderException` is thrown with a custom message and the original exception as the cause.

This way, if the underlying synchronization provider's writer fails to write the updates back to the data source, the method will throw a `SyncProviderException` with a clear error message.
