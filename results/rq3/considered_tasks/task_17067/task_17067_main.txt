Please write a java method that Propagates all row update, insert and delete changes to the data source backing this CachedRowSet object using the specified Connection object to establish a connection to the data source.
Here's an example Java method that propagates all row update, insert, and delete changes to the data source backing a CachedRowSet object using a specified Connection object:

```java
public void propagateChanges(CachedRowSet cachedRowSet, Connection connection) throws SQLException {
    cachedRowSet.acceptChanges(connection);
}
```

In this method, the `acceptChanges()` method of the `CachedRowSet` object is called with the specified `Connection` object as a parameter. This method propagates all changes made to the `CachedRowSet` object to the data source backing it.

Note that this method may throw a `SQLException` if there are any errors during the propagation process. You may want to handle this exception appropriately in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the underlying synchronization provider's writer fails to write the updates back to the data source for javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet.acceptChanges(java.sql.Connection) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SyncProviderException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for a failure in the underlying synchronization provider's writer and throws a `SyncProviderException` if necessary:

```java
public void propagateChanges(CachedRowSet cachedRowSet, Connection connection) throws SQLException, SyncProviderException {
    try {
        cachedRowSet.acceptChanges(connection);
    } catch (SyncProviderException e) {
        // If the underlying synchronization provider's writer fails to write the updates back to the data source,
        // throw a SyncProviderException with the original exception as the cause
        throw new SyncProviderException("Failed to write updates back to data source", e);
    }
}
```

In this updated method, the `acceptChanges()` method is called as before, but now it is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches any `SyncProviderException` that may be thrown. If such an exception is caught, a new `SyncProviderException` is thrown with a custom message and the original exception as the cause.

This way, if the underlying synchronization provider's writer fails to write the updates back to the data source, the method will throw a `SyncProviderException` with a clear error message.
