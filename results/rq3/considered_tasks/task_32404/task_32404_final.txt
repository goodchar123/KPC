
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks for I/O errors while writing to the underlying OutputStream for java.io.ObjectOutputStream.defaultWriteObject() and throws an IOException if any errors occur:

```java
private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
    beforeSerialization();
    try {
        // Serialize the children
        out.defaultWriteObject();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle the exception
        throw new IOException("Error while writing to the underlying OutputStream", e);
    }
}
```

This code snippet catches any IOException that occurs while writing to the underlying OutputStream and throws a new IOException with a more descriptive error message. This way, the caller of the method can handle the exception appropriately.
