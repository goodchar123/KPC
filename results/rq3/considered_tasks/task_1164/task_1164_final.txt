Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error handling:

```
public void removeListener(ObjectName mbeanName, NotificationListener listener) throws Exception {
    MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
    try {
        mbs.removeNotificationListener(mbeanName, listener);
    } catch (InstanceNotFoundException e) {
        throw new Exception("The MBean name provided does not match any of the registered MBeans.", e);
    } catch (ListenerNotFoundException e) {
        throw new Exception("The listener is not registered in the MBean.", e);
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new Exception("There is a security manager and the caller does not have the permission required by MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer().", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method includes try-catch blocks to handle the `InstanceNotFoundException`, `ListenerNotFoundException`, and `SecurityException` that may be thrown by the `MBeanServer` methods. If any of these exceptions are caught, the method throws a new `Exception` with a descriptive error message and the original exception as the cause.
