Please write a java method that Creates a default PreparedStatement object capable of returning the auto-generated keys designated by the given array.
Sure, here's an example Java method that creates a default PreparedStatement object capable of returning the auto-generated keys designated by the given array:

```java
public PreparedStatement createPreparedStatement(Connection conn, String sql, String[] columnNames) throws SQLException {
    PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql, columnNames);
    return pstmt;
}
```

This method takes in a Connection object, a SQL query string, and an array of column names as parameters. It then creates a PreparedStatement object using the given SQL query and column names, and returns it. The PreparedStatement object is capable of returning the auto-generated keys designated by the given array. 

Note that this method throws a SQLException if there is an error creating the PreparedStatement object.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.Connection.prepareStatement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public PreparedStatement createPreparedStatement(Connection conn, String sql, String[] columnNames) throws SQLException {
    if (conn == null || conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is null or closed.");
    }
    try {
        PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql, columnNames);
        return pstmt;
    } catch (SQLFeatureNotSupportedException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred.", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the Connection object is null or closed, and throws a SQLException if it is. It then attempts to create a PreparedStatement object using the given SQL query and column names. If the JDBC driver does not support this method, it throws a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException. If a database access error occurs during the creation of the PreparedStatement object, it throws a SQLException with the original exception as the cause.

Note that this method still throws a SQLException if there is an error creating the PreparedStatement object, as in the previous version.
