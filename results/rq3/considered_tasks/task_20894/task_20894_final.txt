
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public PreparedStatement createPreparedStatement(Connection conn, String sql, String[] columnNames) throws SQLException {
    if (conn == null || conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is null or closed.");
    }
    try {
        PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql, columnNames);
        return pstmt;
    } catch (SQLFeatureNotSupportedException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred.", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the Connection object is null or closed, and throws a SQLException if it is. It then attempts to create a PreparedStatement object using the given SQL query and column names. If the JDBC driver does not support this method, it throws a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException. If a database access error occurs during the creation of the PreparedStatement object, it throws a SQLException with the original exception as the cause.

Note that this method still throws a SQLException if there is an error creating the PreparedStatement object, as in the previous version.
