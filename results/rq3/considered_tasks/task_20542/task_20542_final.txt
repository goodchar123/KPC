
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for an I/O error when writing to the output stream:

```java
public void writeAttributeToStream(Attribute attribute, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    byte[] attributeBytes = attribute.toByteArray();
    try {
        outputStream.write(attributeBytes);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error writing attribute to stream", e);
    }
}
```

This method is similar to the previous one, but it now uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur when writing to the output stream. If an `IOException` is caught, the method throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while writing the attribute to the stream, and the original exception is passed as the cause of the new exception.

This way, if an I/O error occurs, the method will throw an `IOException` with a clear error message that can be used to diagnose the problem.
