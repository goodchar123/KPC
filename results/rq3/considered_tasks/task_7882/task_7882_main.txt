Please write a java method that Returns the code point preceding the given index of the CharSequence.
Here's a Java method that returns the code point preceding the given index of the CharSequence:

```java
public static int getCodePointBefore(CharSequence seq, int index) {
    if (index <= 0 || index > seq.length()) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    int codePoint = seq.charAt(index - 1);
    if (Character.isHighSurrogate((char) codePoint) && index > 1) {
        int codePointBefore = seq.charAt(index - 2);
        if (Character.isLowSurrogate((char) codePointBefore)) {
            return Character.toCodePoint((char) codePointBefore, (char) codePoint);
        }
    }
    return codePoint;
}
```

This method takes two parameters: a CharSequence `seq` and an integer `index`. It first checks if the index is within the bounds of the CharSequence. If it is not, it throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

Next, it gets the code point at the given index minus one (since we want the code point before the given index). If the code point is a high surrogate and the index is greater than one, it checks if the previous character is a low surrogate. If it is, it returns the code point represented by the surrogate pair. Otherwise, it just returns the code point at the given index minus one.

Note that this method assumes that the CharSequence contains valid Unicode code points and surrogate pairs. If the CharSequence contains invalid code units, the behavior of this method is undefined.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the index argument is negative or not less than          length() for java.lang.CharSequence.charAt(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the index argument is negative or not less than length() for java.lang.CharSequence.charAt(int), and throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if it is:

```java
public static int getCodePointBefore(CharSequence seq, int index) {
    if (index < 1 || index > seq.length()) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    int codePoint = seq.charAt(index - 1);
    if (Character.isHighSurrogate((char) codePoint) && index > 1) {
        int codePointBefore = seq.charAt(index - 2);
        if (Character.isLowSurrogate((char) codePointBefore)) {
            return Character.toCodePoint((char) codePointBefore, (char) codePoint);
        }
    }
    return codePoint;
}
```

This updated method checks if the index is less than 1 or greater than the length of the CharSequence. If it is, it throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException. This ensures that the index is within the valid range for the charAt(int) method of the CharSequence interface.
