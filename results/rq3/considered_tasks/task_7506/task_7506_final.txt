Here is the modified Java method that checks if a security manager exists and its `checkPropertiesAccess` method doesn't allow access to the system properties for `java.lang.System.getProperties()`. If the security manager exists and doesn't allow access, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```java
public static void printSystemProperties() {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        try {
            securityManager.checkPropertiesAccess();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("Access to system properties is not allowed", e);
        }
    }
    Properties properties = System.getProperties();
    Set<String> keys = properties.stringPropertyNames();
    for (String key : keys) {
        System.out.println(key + " = " + properties.getProperty(key));
    }
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager exists using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a security manager exists, it calls the `checkPropertiesAccess()` method to check if access to system properties is allowed. If the `checkPropertiesAccess()` method throws a `SecurityException`, it throws a new `SecurityException` with a custom message and the original exception as the cause.

If access to system properties is allowed, the method proceeds to get the system properties and print them out as before.
