Please write a java method that Determines the current system properties.
Here is a Java method that determines the current system properties:

```java
public static void printSystemProperties() {
    Properties properties = System.getProperties();
    Set<String> keys = properties.stringPropertyNames();
    for (String key : keys) {
        System.out.println(key + " = " + properties.getProperty(key));
    }
}
```

This method uses the `System.getProperties()` method to get a `Properties` object that contains all of the system properties. It then iterates over the keys in the `Properties` object and prints out each key-value pair using the `getProperty()` method.

Please check if a security manager exists and its             checkPropertiesAccess method doesn't allow access             to the system properties. for java.lang.System.getProperties() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here is the modified Java method that checks if a security manager exists and its `checkPropertiesAccess` method doesn't allow access to the system properties for `java.lang.System.getProperties()`. If the security manager exists and doesn't allow access, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```java
public static void printSystemProperties() {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        try {
            securityManager.checkPropertiesAccess();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("Access to system properties is not allowed", e);
        }
    }
    Properties properties = System.getProperties();
    Set<String> keys = properties.stringPropertyNames();
    for (String key : keys) {
        System.out.println(key + " = " + properties.getProperty(key));
    }
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager exists using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a security manager exists, it calls the `checkPropertiesAccess()` method to check if access to system properties is allowed. If the `checkPropertiesAccess()` method throws a `SecurityException`, it throws a new `SecurityException` with a custom message and the original exception as the cause.

If access to system properties is allowed, the method proceeds to get the system properties and print them out as before.
