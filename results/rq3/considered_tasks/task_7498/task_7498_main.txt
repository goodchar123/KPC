Please write a java method that Reassigns the "standard" output stream.
Here's a Java method that reassigns the "standard" output stream:

```java
public static void redirectStandardOutputToFile(String fileName) {
    try {
        // Create a new PrintStream that writes to the specified file
        PrintStream fileStream = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(fileName));
        
        // Redirect the "standard" output stream to the new PrintStream
        System.setOut(fileStream);
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        // Handle the exception if the file cannot be found
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This method takes a `fileName` parameter that specifies the name of the file to which the "standard" output stream should be redirected. It creates a new `PrintStream` object that writes to the specified file, and then uses the `System.setOut()` method to redirect the "standard" output stream to the new `PrintStream`. If the file cannot be found, the method prints the stack trace of the `FileNotFoundException`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a security manager exists and its        checkPermission method doesn't allow        reassigning of the standard output stream. for java.lang.System.setOut(java.io.PrintStream) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if a security manager exists and its `checkPermission` method doesn't allow reassigning of the standard output stream. If the security manager exists and doesn't allow the operation, the method throws a `SecurityException`:

```java
public static void redirectStandardOutputToFile(String fileName) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("setIO"));
    }
    try {
        // Create a new PrintStream that writes to the specified file
        PrintStream fileStream = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(fileName));
        
        // Redirect the "standard" output stream to the new PrintStream
        System.setOut(fileStream);
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
        // Handle the exception if the file cannot be found
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager exists, it calls its `checkPermission` method with a `RuntimePermission` object that represents the permission to set the input and output streams. If the security manager doesn't allow the operation, it throws a `SecurityException`.

If the security manager allows the operation or if no security manager exists, the method proceeds to create a new `PrintStream` object that writes to the specified file, and then uses the `System.setOut()` method to redirect the "standard" output stream to the new `PrintStream`. If the file cannot be found, the method prints the stack trace of the `FileNotFoundException`.
