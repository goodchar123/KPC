Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks:

```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannelGroup;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class AsyncChannelGroupExample {

    public static AsynchronousChannelGroup createChannelGroup(int numThreads) throws IOException {
        if (numThreads <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number of threads must be greater than 0");
        }
        try {
            return AsynchronousChannelGroup.withFixedThreadPool(numThreads, Executors.defaultThreadFactory());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error creating channel group", e);
        }
    }

}
```

This updated method first checks if the `numThreads` argument is less than or equal to 0. If it is, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that the number of threads must be greater than 0.

Next, the method attempts to create the asynchronous channel group using the `AsynchronousChannelGroup.withFixedThreadPool()` method. If an `IOException` occurs during this process, the method catches the exception and re-throws it as a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message.

These checks help ensure that the method is used correctly and that any errors that occur during channel group creation are properly handled.
