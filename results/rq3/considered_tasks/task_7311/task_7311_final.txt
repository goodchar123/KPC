Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks for removing a shutdown hook:

```java
public void removeShutdownHook(Thread hook) throws IllegalArgumentException, IllegalStateException, SecurityException {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("shutdownHooks"));
    }
    try {
        if (!Runtime.getRuntime().removeShutdownHook(hook)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Hook has not been registered");
        }
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Virtual machine is already in the process of shutting down");
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Security manager denies RuntimePermission(\"shutdownHooks\")");
    }
}
```

This updated method takes a `Thread` object as its argument, which represents the shutdown hook to be removed. It first checks if a security manager is present and if it denies the `RuntimePermission("shutdownHooks")`. It then attempts to remove the shutdown hook using the `removeShutdownHook()` method of the `Runtime` class. If the hook has not been registered, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. If the virtual machine is already in the process of shutting down, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. Finally, if a security exception occurs, it throws a `SecurityException`.
