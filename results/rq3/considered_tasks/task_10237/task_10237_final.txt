Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error handling for `RandomAccessFile.length()`:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileReader {
    public static long readSignedLong(String filename) throws IOException {
        RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(filename, "r");
        long value;
        try {
            long fileLength = file.length();
            if (fileLength < 8) {
                throw new EOFException("File is too short to contain a long value");
            }
            value = file.readLong();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            file.close();
            throw e;
        }
        file.close();
        return value;
    }
}
```

This updated method first calls `RandomAccessFile.length()` to get the length of the file. If an I/O error occurs while getting the file length, the `RandomAccessFile` is closed and an `IOException` is thrown. If the file is too short to contain a `long` value, an `EOFException` is thrown. If an I/O error occurs while reading the file, the `RandomAccessFile` is closed and the exception is re-thrown. Finally, the `RandomAccessFile` is closed before the method returns the `long` value.
