Please write a java method that Fetches the text contained within the given portion of the document.
Sure, here's a Java method that fetches the text contained within the given portion of the document:

```java
public String fetchText(String document, int startIndex, int endIndex) {
    return document.substring(startIndex, endIndex);
}
```

This method takes in three parameters: the `document` string, which represents the entire document, and the `startIndex` and `endIndex` integers, which represent the starting and ending indices of the portion of the document you want to fetch.

The method then uses the `substring` method of the `String` class to extract the text between the specified indices and returns it as a new string.

You can call this method like this:

```java
String document = "This is a sample document.";
int startIndex = 5;
int endIndex = 16;

String text = fetchText(document, startIndex, endIndex);
System.out.println(text); // Output: "is a sample"
```

In this example, the `fetchText` method is called with the `document` string, a `startIndex` of 5 (which corresponds to the first "is" in the document), and an `endIndex` of 16 (which corresponds to the last "e" in "sample"). The method then returns the text between those indices, which is "is a sample".
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the             beginIndex is negative, or             endIndex is larger than the length of             this String object, or             beginIndex is larger than             endIndex. for java.lang.String.substring(int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of them are true:

```java
public String fetchText(String document, int startIndex, int endIndex) {
    if (startIndex < 0 || endIndex > document.length() || startIndex > endIndex) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    return document.substring(startIndex, endIndex);
}
```

This updated method first checks if `startIndex` is negative, or if `endIndex` is larger than the length of the `document` string, or if `startIndex` is larger than `endIndex`. If any of these conditions are true, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

If none of these conditions are true, the method uses the `substring` method of the `String` class to extract the text between the specified indices and returns it as a new string.

You can call this method like this:

```java
String document = "This is a sample document.";
int startIndex = 5;
int endIndex = 16;

try {
    String text = fetchText(document, startIndex, endIndex);
    System.out.println(text); // Output: "is a sample"
} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    System.out.println("Invalid indices provided.");
}
```

In this example, the `fetchText` method is called with the `document` string, a `startIndex` of 5 (which corresponds to the first "is" in the document), and an `endIndex` of 16 (which corresponds to the last "e" in "sample"). The method then returns the text between those indices, which is "is a sample".

If invalid indices are provided (e.g. `startIndex` is negative), the method throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, which can be caught and handled appropriately.
