Here's the updated Java method that checks for `InterruptedException` and `IOException`:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannelGroup;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class GroupShutdown {

    public static void shutdownGroup(AsynchronousChannelGroup group) throws InterruptedException, IOException {
        try {
            group.shutdown();
            if (!group.awaitTermination(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                group.shutdownNow();
                if (!group.awaitTermination(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                    throw new IOException("Could not terminate channels");
                }
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            group.shutdownNow();
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            throw e;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            group.shutdownNow();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method now throws `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting for the channels to terminate. It also throws `IOException` if an I/O error occurs during the `shutdownNow()` method call.

To handle the `InterruptedException`, we catch it and call `shutdownNow()` to force the closure of any remaining channels in the group. We also re-interrupt the thread to ensure that the interrupted status is preserved.

To handle the `IOException`, we catch it and call `shutdownNow()` to force the closure of any remaining channels in the group. We then re-throw the exception to indicate that the channels could not be terminated.
