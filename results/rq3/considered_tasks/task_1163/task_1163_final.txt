Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for `InstanceNotFoundException` and `IOException` when adding a listener to an MBean, and throws the appropriate exception message:

```java
import javax.management.*;

public class MBeanListenerExample {

    public void addMBeanListener(MBeanServerConnection mbsc, ObjectName mbeanName, NotificationListener listener) throws InstanceNotFoundException, IOException {
        try {
            mbsc.addNotificationListener(mbeanName, listener, null, null);
        } catch (InstanceNotFoundException e) {
            throw new InstanceNotFoundException("The MBean name provided does not match any of the registered MBeans.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("A communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server.");
        }
    }
}
```

This method is similar to the previous one, but it now includes a try-catch block that catches `InstanceNotFoundException` and `IOException` separately. If either of these exceptions is caught, the method throws a new exception with an appropriate error message.

Note that this method does not handle other types of exceptions that may be thrown by the `addNotificationListener` method. You may want to add additional catch blocks to handle these exceptions as needed.
