
Certainly, here is an updated code snippet that includes the requested exception handling:

```
public Object readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    try {
        Object obj = in.readObject();
        if (CMM.isRegistered(obj)) {
            return CMM.getRegisteredInstance(obj);
        } else {
            CMM.registerInstance(obj);
            return obj;
        }
    } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
        throw new ClassNotFoundException("Class of a serialized object cannot be found.", e);
    } catch (InvalidClassException e) {
        throw new InvalidClassException("Something is wrong with a class used by deserialization.", e);
    } catch (StreamCorruptedException e) {
        throw new StreamCorruptedException("Control information in the stream is inconsistent.");
    } catch (OptionalDataException e) {
        throw new OptionalDataException("Primitive data was found in the stream instead of objects.");
    }
}
```

Note that this code catches the various exceptions that can be thrown by `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` and rethrows them with more specific error messages. You may want to customize these error messages to better fit your specific use case.
