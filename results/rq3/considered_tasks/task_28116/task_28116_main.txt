Please write a java method that Resolves instances being deserialized into instances registered with CMM.
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a complete solution to this problem as it requires knowledge of the specific implementation of CMM and the context in which the deserialization is occurring. However, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach this problem.

First, you will need to understand how CMM registers instances and how it identifies them. This will likely involve reading the documentation or source code for CMM.

Once you understand how CMM works, you can write a custom deserialization method that checks if the deserialized instance is already registered with CMM. If it is, you can return the registered instance instead of the deserialized one. If it is not registered, you can register it with CMM and return the deserialized instance.

Here is some sample code that demonstrates this approach:

```
public Object readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    Object obj = in.readObject();
    if (CMM.isRegistered(obj)) {
        return CMM.getRegisteredInstance(obj);
    } else {
        CMM.registerInstance(obj);
        return obj;
    }
}
```

Note that this code assumes that CMM has static methods for checking if an instance is registered (`isRegistered`) and for getting a registered instance (`getRegisteredInstance`). You will need to replace these with the appropriate methods for your implementation of CMM.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check Class of a serialized object cannot be          found. for java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ClassNotFoundException.
Please check Something is wrong with a class used by          deserialization. for java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InvalidClassException.
Please check Control information in the          stream is inconsistent. for java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw StreamCorruptedException.
Please check Primitive data was found in the          stream instead of objects. for java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw OptionalDataException.
Certainly, here is an updated code snippet that includes the requested exception handling:

```
public Object readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    try {
        Object obj = in.readObject();
        if (CMM.isRegistered(obj)) {
            return CMM.getRegisteredInstance(obj);
        } else {
            CMM.registerInstance(obj);
            return obj;
        }
    } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
        throw new ClassNotFoundException("Class of a serialized object cannot be found.", e);
    } catch (InvalidClassException e) {
        throw new InvalidClassException("Something is wrong with a class used by deserialization.", e);
    } catch (StreamCorruptedException e) {
        throw new StreamCorruptedException("Control information in the stream is inconsistent.");
    } catch (OptionalDataException e) {
        throw new OptionalDataException("Primitive data was found in the stream instead of objects.");
    }
}
```

Note that this code catches the various exceptions that can be thrown by `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` and rethrows them with more specific error messages. You may want to customize these error messages to better fit your specific use case.
