Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this year with the specified field set to a new value.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of the current year with the specified field set to a new value:

```java
public static Year setField(Year year, TemporalField field, long newValue) {
    return year.with(field, newValue);
}
```

This method takes in a `Year` object, a `TemporalField` object representing the field to be set (e.g. `ChronoField.YEAR`), and a `long` value representing the new value for the field. It then returns a new `Year` object with the specified field set to the new value.

Here's an example usage of this method:

```java
Year currentYear = Year.now(); // e.g. 2021
Year newYear = setField(currentYear, ChronoField.YEAR, 2022);
System.out.println(newYear); // prints "2022"
```
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the field cannot be set for java.time.Year.with(java.time.temporal.TemporalField,long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Please check if the field is not supported for java.time.Year.with(java.time.temporal.TemporalField,long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException.
Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.Year.with(java.time.temporal.TemporalField,long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static Year setField(Year year, TemporalField field, long newValue) {
    try {
        return year.with(field, newValue);
    } catch (DateTimeException | UnsupportedTemporalTypeException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while setting field");
    }
}
```

This method first attempts to set the specified field to the new value using the `with` method of the `Year` class. If an exception is thrown due to an invalid field or value, it is caught and re-thrown. If an `ArithmeticException` is thrown due to numeric overflow, it is caught and a new `ArithmeticException` with a more descriptive message is thrown.

Here's an example usage of this updated method:

```java
Year currentYear = Year.now(); // e.g. 2021
Year newYear = setField(currentYear, ChronoField.YEAR, 10000000000L); // throws ArithmeticException
``` 

In this example, the `setField` method is called with a value that causes a numeric overflow, resulting in an `ArithmeticException` being thrown with the message "Numeric overflow occurred while setting field".
