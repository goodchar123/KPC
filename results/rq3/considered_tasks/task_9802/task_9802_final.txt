Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an `IOException` during the `flush()` operation and throws it if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.BufferedOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class Example {
    public static void flushBufferedOutputStream(BufferedOutputStream bos) throws IOException {
        try {
            bos.flush();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error flushing BufferedOutputStream", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method now uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that occurs during the `flush()` operation. If an `IOException` is caught, the method throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while flushing the `BufferedOutputStream`. The original `IOException` that was caught is passed as the cause of the new `IOException`.
