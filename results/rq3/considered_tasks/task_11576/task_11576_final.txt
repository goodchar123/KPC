Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error while writing the buffer's content to the storage device containing the mapped file and throws an `UncheckedIOException` if an error occurs:

```java
import java.io.UncheckedIOException;
import java.nio.MappedByteBuffer;

public static void forceMappedBufferToFile(MappedByteBuffer buffer) {
    try {
        buffer.force();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException("Error occurred while writing buffer content to storage device", e);
    }
}
```

This method now has a try-catch block that catches any `Exception` that may occur while calling the `force()` method on the `MappedByteBuffer` object. If an exception is caught, an `UncheckedIOException` is thrown with a message indicating that an error occurred while writing the buffer's content to the storage device.
