Please write a java method that Writes a Clob object in the Java programming language to this SQLOutputImpl object.
Here's an example Java method that writes a Clob object to an SQLOutputImpl object:

```
public void writeClobToSQLOutput(Clob clob, SQLOutputImpl sqlOutput) throws SQLException {
    if (clob == null) {
        sqlOutput.writeNull();
    } else {
        Reader reader = clob.getCharacterStream();
        char[] buffer = new char[1024];
        int bytesRead;
        try {
            while ((bytesRead = reader.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                sqlOutput.writeString(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Error reading Clob data", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes a Clob object and an SQLOutputImpl object as parameters. If the Clob object is null, it writes a null value to the SQLOutputImpl object using the `writeNull()` method. Otherwise, it reads the Clob data using a character stream and writes it to the SQLOutputImpl object using the `writeString()` method. If an error occurs while reading the Clob data, a SQLException is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if there is an error accessing the         CLOB value for java.sql.Clob.getCharacterStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver         does not support this method for java.sql.Clob.getCharacterStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for errors accessing the Clob value and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```
public void writeClobToSQLOutput(Clob clob, SQLOutputImpl sqlOutput) throws SQLException {
    if (clob == null) {
        sqlOutput.writeNull();
    } else {
        Reader reader;
        try {
            reader = clob.getCharacterStream();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Error accessing Clob data", e);
        }
        if (reader == null) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support getCharacterStream() for Clob");
        }
        char[] buffer = new char[1024];
        int bytesRead;
        try {
            while ((bytesRead = reader.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                sqlOutput.writeString(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Error reading Clob data", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first tries to get the character stream from the Clob object using `getCharacterStream()`. If an SQLException is thrown, it is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message. If the character stream is null, it means that the JDBC driver does not support this method for Clob, so a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException is thrown.

If there are no errors, the method reads the Clob data using a character stream and writes it to the SQLOutputImpl object using the `writeString()` method. If an error occurs while reading the Clob data, a SQLException is thrown.
