Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for errors accessing the Clob value and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```
public void writeClobToSQLOutput(Clob clob, SQLOutputImpl sqlOutput) throws SQLException {
    if (clob == null) {
        sqlOutput.writeNull();
    } else {
        Reader reader;
        try {
            reader = clob.getCharacterStream();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Error accessing Clob data", e);
        }
        if (reader == null) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support getCharacterStream() for Clob");
        }
        char[] buffer = new char[1024];
        int bytesRead;
        try {
            while ((bytesRead = reader.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                sqlOutput.writeString(new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead));
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Error reading Clob data", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first tries to get the character stream from the Clob object using `getCharacterStream()`. If an SQLException is thrown, it is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message. If the character stream is null, it means that the JDBC driver does not support this method for Clob, so a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException is thrown.

If there are no errors, the method reads the Clob data using a character stream and writes it to the SQLOutputImpl object using the `writeString()` method. If an error occurs while reading the Clob data, a SQLException is thrown.
