
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a database access error when calling `java.sql.Connection.isClosed()`:

```java
public String getSchemaTerm(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    boolean isClosed = false;
    try {
        isClosed = conn.isClosed();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to check if connection is closed", e);
    }
    if (isClosed) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = null;
    try {
        metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve database metadata", e);
    }
    if (metaData == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve database metadata");
    }
    String schemaTerm = null;
    try {
        schemaTerm = metaData.getSchemaTerm();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve schema term from database metadata", e);
    }
    if (schemaTerm == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve schema term from database metadata");
    }
    return schemaTerm;
}
```

This method first checks if the `Connection` object is closed using the `isClosed()` method, and catches any `SQLException` that may occur. If a `SQLException` occurs, it throws a new `SQLException` with an error message indicating that it failed to check if the connection is closed, and includes the original `SQLException` as the cause. If the connection is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an error message indicating that the connection is closed.

It then retrieves the `DatabaseMetaData` object using the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` object, and catches any `SQLException` that may occur. If a `SQLException` occurs, it throws a new `SQLException` with an error message indicating that the database metadata could not be retrieved, and includes the original `SQLException` as the cause. If the `DatabaseMetaData` object is `null`, it throws a `SQLException` with an error message indicating that the database metadata could not be retrieved. 

It then calls the `getSchemaTerm()` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` object to get the schema term, and catches any `SQLException` that may occur. If a `SQLException` occurs, it throws a new `SQLException` with an error message indicating that the schema term could not be retrieved, and includes the original `SQLException` as the cause. If the schema term is `null`, it throws a `SQLException` with an error message indicating that the schema term could not be retrieved. Otherwise, it returns the schema term.
