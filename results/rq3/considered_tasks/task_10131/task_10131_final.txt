Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error when reading from the input stream:

```java
public static int readByte() throws IOException {
    InputStream inputStream = System.in;
    int inputByte = inputStream.read();
    if (inputByte == -1) {
        throw new IOException("End of stream reached");
    }
    return (inputByte & 0xff);
}
```

This method first reads one byte from the standard input stream (`System.in`) and stores it in an integer variable `inputByte`. If the end of the stream is reached (`inputByte` is `-1`), the method throws an `IOException` with a message "End of stream reached". Otherwise, it zero-extends the byte to an integer by performing a bitwise AND operation with `0xff` and returns the result. This ensures that the returned value is always in the range 0 through 255. 

By checking for an I/O error and throwing an `IOException` if necessary, this method provides more robust error handling.
