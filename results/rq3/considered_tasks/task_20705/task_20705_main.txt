Please write a java method that This method releases the resources that the Clob object holds.
Here is a Java method that releases the resources held by a Clob object:

```java
public void releaseClobResources(Clob clob) throws SQLException {
    if (clob != null) {
        clob.free();
    }
}
```

This method takes a Clob object as a parameter and calls its `free()` method to release the resources it holds. It also checks if the Clob object is not null before calling the `free()` method to avoid any NullPointerExceptions. 

Note that this method throws a SQLException if there is an error while releasing the resources. You can handle this exception in the calling code using a try-catch block.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an error occurs releasing         the Clob's resources for java.sql.Clob.free() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver         does not support this method for java.sql.Clob.free() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for errors and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```java
public void releaseClobResources(Clob clob) throws SQLException {
    if (clob != null) {
        try {
            clob.free();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Check if the error is due to unsupported operation
            if (e.getErrorCode() == 0 && "Method not supported".equals(e.getMessage())) {
                throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Clob.free() is not supported by the JDBC driver", e);
            } else {
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the Clob object is not null, and then calls its `free()` method. If an SQLException is thrown while calling `free()`, it checks if the error is due to the method not being supported by the JDBC driver. If that's the case, it throws a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException with the original exception as the cause. Otherwise, it rethrows the original exception.

Note that this method still throws an SQLException if there is an error while releasing the resources, but it also handles the case where the method is not supported by the JDBC driver.
