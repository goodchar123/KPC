Please write a java method that Compacts this buffer  (optional operation).
Here's an example Java method that compacts a buffer:

```java
public static void compactBuffer(ByteBuffer buffer) {
    buffer.flip();
    buffer.compact();
}
```

This method first flips the buffer to set the limit to the current position and the position to 0. Then it calls the `compact()` method to move any remaining bytes in the buffer to the beginning and update the position and limit accordingly. This method assumes that the buffer is in write mode and has some remaining bytes that need to be compacted.

Please check If this buffer is read only for java.nio.ByteBuffer.compact() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ReadOnlyBufferException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the buffer is read-only before compacting it:

```java
public static void compactBuffer(ByteBuffer buffer) {
    if (buffer.isReadOnly()) {
        throw new ReadOnlyBufferException();
    }
    buffer.flip();
    buffer.compact();
}
```

This method first checks if the buffer is read-only using the `isReadOnly()` method. If the buffer is read-only, it throws a `ReadOnlyBufferException`. Otherwise, it proceeds with the compacting process as before.
