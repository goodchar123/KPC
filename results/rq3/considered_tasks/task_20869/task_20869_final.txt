
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a database access error when calling `java.sql.Connection.isClosed()`:

```java
public boolean isClosed(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    try {
        return conn.isClosed();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Log the error or handle it as appropriate
        throw new SQLException("Error checking connection status", e);
    }
}
```

This method now includes a try-catch block that catches any `SQLException` that may occur when calling `conn.isClosed()`. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown as a new `SQLException` with a more descriptive error message. This way, the caller of the method can handle the error appropriately.
