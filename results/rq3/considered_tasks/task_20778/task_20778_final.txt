
Here's the updated Java method that includes error handling for the scenarios you mentioned:

```java
public void executeStatementWithGeneratedKeys(Connection conn, String sql, String[] columnNames) throws SQLException {
    PreparedStatement stmt = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        try {
            if (conn.isClosed()) {
                throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
            }
            DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
            if (!metaData.supportsGeneratedKeys()) {
                throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Generated keys not supported by JDBC driver");
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // handle database access error or closed connection error for getMetaData() or isClosed()
            throw e;
        }
        stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql, columnNames);
        stmt.executeUpdate();
        rs = stmt.getGeneratedKeys();
        while (rs.next()) {
            // process the generated keys
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            // handle timeout exception
        } else if (e.getMessage().contains("closed")) {
            // handle closed statement or result set exception
        } else {
            // handle other database access errors
        }
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (rs != null) {
            try {
                rs.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                // handle database access error for closing result set
            }
        }
        if (stmt != null) {
            try {
                stmt.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                // handle database access error for closing statement
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method includes a `try-catch` block to handle the different types of exceptions that may occur when calling `getMetaData()` or `isClosed()`. If a database access error or closed connection error occurs, it is handled in the `catch` block and re-thrown to propagate the error up the call stack.

The method also includes a check to see if the JDBC driver supports generated keys. If it does not, a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown.

The rest of the method is the same as before, with a `try-catch` block to handle the different types of exceptions that may occur during the execution of the statement, and a `finally` block to close the result set and statement. Any database access errors that occur during the closing of the result set or statement are handled in their respective `catch` blocks. Finally, the original exception is re-thrown to propagate the error up the call stack.
