
You are correct, it is important to check if the key is null before calling `UIManager.getInt()` to avoid a `NullPointerException`. Here's the updated code snippet with the null check:

```java
public static Border createDashedBorder(Paint paint, float relativeLength, float relativeSpacing) {
    if (paint == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Paint cannot be null");
    }
    if (relativeLength <= 0 || relativeSpacing <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Relative length and spacing must be greater than 0");
    }
    Object borderThickness = UIManager.get("Component.borderThickness");
    if (borderThickness == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Component.borderThickness is null");
    }
    int thickness = (int) borderThickness;
    return BorderFactory.createDashedBorder(paint, 
        Math.round(relativeLength * thickness), 
        Math.round(relativeSpacing * thickness), 
        0, 
        true);
}
```

In addition to checking for a null key, I've also added checks for a null paint and for relative length and spacing values that are less than or equal to 0. These checks help ensure that the method is called with valid arguments.
