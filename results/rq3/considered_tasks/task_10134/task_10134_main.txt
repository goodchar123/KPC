Please write a java method that Reads two input bytes and returns a char value.
Here's a Java method that reads two input bytes and returns a char value:

```java
public static char readCharFromBytes(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    byte[] bytes = new byte[2];
    int bytesRead = inputStream.read(bytes);
    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        throw new EOFException("End of stream reached");
    }
    return (char) ((bytes[0] << 8) | (bytes[1] & 0xFF));
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as input and reads two bytes from it. It then combines these two bytes into a single `char` value and returns it.

Note that this method assumes that the input stream contains two bytes that represent a single `char` value. If the input stream contains more or less than two bytes, or if the bytes do not represent a valid `char` value, the behavior of this method is undefined.

Please check if b is null. for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
You're right, it's important to check if the byte array is null before calling `InputStream.read(byte[])`. Here's the updated code snippet that includes the null check:

```java
public static char readCharFromBytes(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    byte[] bytes = new byte[2];
    Objects.requireNonNull(bytes, "byte array must not be null");
    int bytesRead = inputStream.read(bytes);
    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        throw new EOFException("End of stream reached");
    }
    return (char) ((bytes[0] << 8) | (bytes[1] & 0xFF));
}
```

This method now checks if the `bytes` array is null using `Objects.requireNonNull()` before calling `InputStream.read(byte[])`. If the array is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
