Please write a java method that Writes a sequence of longs to the stream at the current position.
Here's an example Java method that writes a sequence of longs to the stream at the current position:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Example {
    public static void writeLongs(DataOutputStream stream, long[] longs) throws IOException {
        for (long l : longs) {
            stream.writeLong(l);
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes a `DataOutputStream` object and an array of `long` values as input. It then iterates over the array and writes each `long` value to the stream using the `writeLong()` method of the `DataOutputStream` class. If an `IOException` occurs during the write operation, it is thrown to the calling method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.DataOutputStream.writeLong(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error during the write operation and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class Example {
    public static void writeLongs(DataOutputStream stream, long[] longs) throws IOException {
        for (long l : longs) {
            try {
                stream.writeLong(l);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error writing long value to stream", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This method is similar to the previous one, but it now includes a try-catch block around the `writeLong()` method call. If an `IOException` occurs during the write operation, it is caught and a new `IOException` is thrown with a more descriptive error message. The original `IOException` is passed as the cause of the new exception to provide more information about the error.
