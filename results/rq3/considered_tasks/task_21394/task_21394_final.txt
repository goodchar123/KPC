
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for errors and exceptions:

```
public InputStream getXMLStream(SQLXML sqlxml) throws SQLException {
    if (!sqlxml.isReadable()) {
        throw new SQLException("SQLXML instance is not readable");
    }
    try {
        return sqlxml.getBinaryStream();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error processing XML value", e);
    } catch (AbstractMethodError e) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported by JDBC driver", e);
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the SQLXML instance is readable using the `isReadable()` method. If it is not readable, a SQLException is thrown.

Next, the method attempts to retrieve the XML value as a stream using the `getBinaryStream()` method. If a SQLException is thrown, it is re-thrown. If any other exception is thrown, a new SQLException is thrown with the original exception as the cause.

Finally, if the JDBC driver does not support the `getBinaryStream()` method, an `AbstractMethodError` is thrown. In this case, a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown instead with the original exception as the cause.
