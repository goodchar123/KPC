
Here's the modified Java method that checks if the regular expression's syntax is invalid for `java.lang.String.split(java.lang.String)` and throws a `PatternSyntaxException` if necessary:

```java
public static String[] getFileTypes(FileWriter writer, CharSequence sequence) throws PatternSyntaxException {
    String[] types = null;
    try {
        writer.write(sequence.toString());
        String contentType = writer.getContentType();
        if (contentType == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Content type is null");
        }
        types = contentType.split(",");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
        throw e;
    }
    return types;
}
```

This method is similar to the previous one, but it now includes a `try-catch` block that catches a `PatternSyntaxException` if the regular expression's syntax is invalid. If this exception is caught, it is re-thrown to the calling method.

Additionally, the method now checks if the `getContentType()` method returns `null` and throws a `NullPointerException` if necessary.

Note that this method assumes that the `FileWriter` object has a `getContentType()` method that returns a string containing the content type of the writer. If your `FileWriter` implementation does not have this method, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
