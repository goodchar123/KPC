Please write a java method that Obtains the file types that this file writer can write from the sequence specified.
Here's a Java method that obtains the file types that a file writer can write from the sequence specified:

```java
public static String[] getFileTypes(FileWriter writer, CharSequence sequence) {
    String[] types = null;
    try {
        writer.write(sequence.toString());
        types = writer.getContentType().split(",");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return types;
}
```

This method takes a `FileWriter` object and a `CharSequence` object as parameters. It writes the `CharSequence` to the writer and then obtains the content type of the writer using the `getContentType()` method. The content type is then split into an array of strings using the comma as a delimiter. This array of strings represents the file types that the writer can write.

Note that this method assumes that the `FileWriter` object has a `getContentType()` method that returns a string containing the content type of the writer. If your `FileWriter` implementation does not have this method, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the regular expression's syntax is invalid for java.lang.String.split(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw PatternSyntaxException.
Here's the modified Java method that checks if the regular expression's syntax is invalid for `java.lang.String.split(java.lang.String)` and throws a `PatternSyntaxException` if necessary:

```java
public static String[] getFileTypes(FileWriter writer, CharSequence sequence) throws PatternSyntaxException {
    String[] types = null;
    try {
        writer.write(sequence.toString());
        String contentType = writer.getContentType();
        if (contentType == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Content type is null");
        }
        types = contentType.split(",");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
        throw e;
    }
    return types;
}
```

This method is similar to the previous one, but it now includes a `try-catch` block that catches a `PatternSyntaxException` if the regular expression's syntax is invalid. If this exception is caught, it is re-thrown to the calling method.

Additionally, the method now checks if the `getContentType()` method returns `null` and throws a `NullPointerException` if necessary.

Note that this method assumes that the `FileWriter` object has a `getContentType()` method that returns a string containing the content type of the writer. If your `FileWriter` implementation does not have this method, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
