Please write a java method that Closes the current ZIP entry and positions the stream for reading the next entry.
Here's a Java method that closes the current ZIP entry and positions the stream for reading the next entry:

```java
public void closeCurrentZipEntry(ZipInputStream zipInputStream) throws IOException {
    zipInputStream.closeEntry();
}
```

This method takes a `ZipInputStream` object as a parameter and calls its `closeEntry()` method to close the current ZIP entry and position the stream for reading the next entry. If an I/O error occurs, it throws an `IOException`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a ZIP file error has occurred for java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.closeEntry() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ZipException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a ZIP file error and throws a `ZipException` if one occurs:

```java
public void closeCurrentZipEntry(ZipInputStream zipInputStream) throws IOException, ZipException {
    if (!zipInputStream.closeEntry()) {
        throw new ZipException("Error closing current ZIP entry");
    }
}
```

This method first calls the `closeEntry()` method on the `ZipInputStream` object to close the current ZIP entry and position the stream for reading the next entry. If `closeEntry()` returns `false`, it means that a ZIP file error has occurred, so the method throws a `ZipException` with an appropriate error message. 

Note that the method now throws both `IOException` and `ZipException`, since `closeEntry()` can throw an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs.
