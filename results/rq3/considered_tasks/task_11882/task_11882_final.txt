Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a ZIP file error and throws a `ZipException` if one occurs:

```java
public void closeCurrentZipEntry(ZipInputStream zipInputStream) throws IOException, ZipException {
    if (!zipInputStream.closeEntry()) {
        throw new ZipException("Error closing current ZIP entry");
    }
}
```

This method first calls the `closeEntry()` method on the `ZipInputStream` object to close the current ZIP entry and position the stream for reading the next entry. If `closeEntry()` returns `false`, it means that a ZIP file error has occurred, so the method throws a `ZipException` with an appropriate error message. 

Note that the method now throws both `IOException` and `ZipException`, since `closeEntry()` can throw an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs.
