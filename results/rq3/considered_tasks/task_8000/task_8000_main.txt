Please write a java method that Returns the index within this String that is offset from the given index by codePointOffset code points.
Here's a Java method that returns the index within a given string that is offset from the given index by a specified number of code points:

```java
public static int offsetByCodePoints(String str, int index, int codePointOffset) {
    return str.offsetByCodePoints(index, codePointOffset);
}
```

This method uses the `offsetByCodePoints` method of the `String` class to calculate the new index based on the given offset. The `offsetByCodePoints` method takes two arguments: the starting index and the number of code points to offset by. It returns the new index that is `codePointOffset` code points away from the starting index.

You can call this method by passing in the string, the starting index, and the code point offset:

```java
String str = "Hello, world!";
int index = 7;
int codePointOffset = 2;
int newIndex = offsetByCodePoints(str, index, codePointOffset);
System.out.println(newIndex); // Output: 9
```

In this example, the starting index is 7 (which corresponds to the letter "w" in the string), and we want to offset by 2 code points. The method returns the new index, which is 9 (which corresponds to the exclamation mark at the end of the string).
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if index   is negative or larger then the length of this   String, or if codePointOffset is positive   and the substring starting with index has fewer   than codePointOffset code points,   or if codePointOffset is negative and the substring   before index has fewer than the absolute value   of codePointOffset code points. for java.lang.String.offsetByCodePoints(int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of them are true:

```java
public static int offsetByCodePoints(String str, int index, int codePointOffset) {
    int strLength = str.length();
    if (index < 0 || index > strLength) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index is out of bounds");
    }
    if (codePointOffset > 0 && index + codePointOffset > strLength) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Substring starting with index has fewer than codePointOffset code points");
    }
    if (codePointOffset < 0 && index + codePointOffset < 0) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Substring before index has fewer than the absolute value of codePointOffset code points");
    }
    return str.offsetByCodePoints(index, codePointOffset);
}
```

This method first checks if the given index is negative or larger than the length of the string. If either of these conditions is true, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Next, it checks if the code point offset is positive and if the substring starting with the given index has fewer than `codePointOffset` code points. If this condition is true, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Finally, it checks if the code point offset is negative and if the substring before the given index has fewer than the absolute value of `codePointOffset` code points. If this condition is true, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

If none of these conditions are true, the method calls the `offsetByCodePoints` method of the `String` class to calculate the new index and returns it.

You can call this method in the same way as before, and it will now throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of the conditions are met:

```java
String str = "Hello, world!";
int index = 7;
int codePointOffset = 2;
int newIndex = offsetByCodePoints(str, index, codePointOffset);
System.out.println(newIndex); // Output: 9

// Example with an invalid index
int invalidIndex = 20;
int newIndex2 = offsetByCodePoints(str, invalidIndex, codePointOffset); // Throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
```
