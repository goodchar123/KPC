
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and closed connections/result sets:

```java
public boolean isNullable(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName) throws SQLException {
    boolean isNullable = false;
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        metaData = conn.getMetaData();
        rs = metaData.getColumns(null, null, tableName, columnName);
        if (rs.next()) {
            String nullable = rs.getString("IS_NULLABLE");
            if (nullable.equals("NO")) {
                isNullable = true;
            }
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (rs != null) {
            try {
                rs.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
    return isNullable;
}
```

In this updated method, we have added a try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that may occur when calling `conn.getMetaData()` or `rs.next()`. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown to the calling method.

We have also added a `finally` block to close the `ResultSet` object if it is not null. This ensures that the `ResultSet` is properly closed even if an exception occurs.

Note that we have only added error handling for the `ResultSet` object, as the `DatabaseMetaData` object does not need to be closed.
