Please write a java method that Cancels this Statement object if both the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement.
Here's an example Java method that cancels a Statement object if both the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement:

```java
public void cancelStatement(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    // Check if the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement
    if (stmt.getConnection().getMetaData().supportsStatementPooling() &&
        stmt.isPoolable()) {
        // Cancel the statement
        stmt.cancel();
    } else {
        // Throw an exception if the statement cannot be cancelled
        throw new SQLException("Statement cannot be cancelled");
    }
}
```

This method takes a Statement object as a parameter and checks if both the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement. If they do, the method cancels the statement using the `cancel()` method. If not, the method throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

    if (!stmt.isWrapperFor(com.mysql.jdbc.Statement.class)) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Cancel not supported by JDBC driver");
    }
    
    // Check if the statement is closed
    if (stmt.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed");
    }
    
    // Check if the connection is closed
    if (stmt.getConnection().isClosed()) {

    }
    
    // Check if the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement
    if (stmt.getConnection().getMetaData().supportsStatementPooling() &&
        stmt.isPoolable()) {
        // Cancel the statement
        stmt.cancel();
    } else {
        // Throw an exception if the statement cannot be cancelled
        throw new SQLException("Statement cannot be cancelled");

This updated method first checks if the JDBC driver supports the `cancel()` method by checking if the `Statement` object is a wrapper for the `com.mysql.jdbc.Statement` class. If not, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`.

Next, it checks if the `Statement` object or its associated connection is closed. If either is closed, it throws a `SQLException`.

Finally, it checks if the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement. If they do, the method cancels the statement using the `cancel()` method. If not, the method throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

This updated method first checks if the `Connection` object associated with the `Statement` object is closed. If it is, it throws a `SQLException`.

Next, it checks if a database access error occurs when calling `getMetaData()` on the `Connection` object. If an error occurs, it throws a `SQLException`.

Then, it checks if the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement. If they do not, it throws a `SQLException`.

Next, it checks if the `Statement` object is poolable. If it is not, it throws a `SQLException`.

Finally, it attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel()` method. If a database access error occurs, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

This updated method first checks if the `Statement` object is closed. If it is, it throws a `SQLException`.

Next, it checks if the `Connection` object associated with the `Statement` object is closed. If it is, it throws a `SQLException`.

Then, it attempts to get the database metadata using the `getMetaData()` method on the `Connection` object. If a database access error occurs, it throws a `SQLException`.

Next, it checks if the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement. If they do not, it throws a `SQLException`.

Then, it checks if the `Statement` object is poolable. If it is not, it throws a `SQLException`.

Finally, it checks if the JDBC driver supports the `cancel()` method. If it does not, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`. If the driver does support the method, it attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel()` method. If a database access error occurs, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.getConnection() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.DatabaseMetaData.supportsStatementPooling() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.isPoolable() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested error handling:

```java
public void cancelStatement(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    // Check if the statement is closed
    if (stmt.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed");
    }
    
    // Check if the connection is closed
    Connection conn = stmt.getConnection();
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    
    // Check if a database access error occurs when calling getMetaData() on the Connection object
    DatabaseMetaData metaData;
    try {
        metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error getting database metadata", e);
    }
    
    // Check if the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement
    if (!metaData.supportsStatementPooling()) {
        throw new SQLException("DBMS does not support statement pooling");
    }
    
    // Check if the statement is poolable
    if (!stmt.isPoolable()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is not poolable");
    }
    
    // Cancel the statement
    try {
        stmt.cancel();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error cancelling statement", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `Statement` object is closed. If it is, it throws a `SQLException`.

Next, it checks if the `Connection` object associated with the `Statement` object is closed. If it is, it throws a `SQLException`.

Then, it attempts to get the database metadata using the `getMetaData()` method on the `Connection` object. If a database access error occurs, it throws a `SQLException`.

Next, it checks if the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement. If they do not, it throws a `SQLException`.

Finally, it attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel()` method. If a database access error occurs, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

This updated method first checks if a database access error occurs when calling `isClosed()` on the `Statement` object. If an error occurs, it throws a `SQLException`.

Next, it checks if the `Connection` object associated with the `Statement` object is closed. If it is, it throws a `SQLException`.

Then, it attempts to get the database metadata using the `getMetaData()` method on the `Connection` object. If a database access error occurs, it throws a `SQLException`.

Next, it checks if a database access error occurs when calling `supportsStatementPooling()` on the `DatabaseMetaData` object. If an error occurs, it throws a `SQLException`.

Then, it checks if the `Statement` object is poolable. If it is not, it throws a `SQLException`. If a database access error occurs during this check, it throws a `SQLException`.

Finally, it checks if the JDBC driver supports the `cancel()` method. If it does not, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`. If the driver does support the method, it attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel()` method.
