
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class DatabaseHelper {
    public static int getMaxTablesInSelectStatement(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        
        try {
            DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
            int maxTables = metaData.getMaxTablesInSelect();
            if (maxTables < 0) {
                throw new SQLException("Database does not support retrieving maximum number of tables in SELECT statement");
            }
            return maxTables;
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Error retrieving metadata: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the `Connection` object. If the connection is closed, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message.

Next, the `getMetaData()` method is called inside a try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that may occur. If an exception is caught, a new `SQLException` is thrown with a message that includes the original exception's message.

Finally, the `getMaxTablesInSelect()` method is called on the `DatabaseMetaData` object, and the result is checked to ensure that it is not negative. If it is negative, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message. Otherwise, the maximum number of tables is returned.
