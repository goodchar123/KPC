Please write a java method that Retrieves the maximum number of tables this database allows in a SELECT statement.
Here's a Java method that retrieves the maximum number of tables allowed in a SELECT statement for a given database:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class DatabaseHelper {
    public static int getMaxTablesInSelectStatement(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
        DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
        return metaData.getMaxTablesInSelect();
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Connection` object as a parameter and returns an integer representing the maximum number of tables allowed in a SELECT statement for the database connected to that `Connection`.

The method uses the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` object to retrieve a `DatabaseMetaData` object, which provides information about the database. The `getMaxTablesInSelect()` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` object is then called to retrieve the maximum number of tables allowed in a SELECT statement for the database.

Note that this method may throw a `SQLException` if there is an error retrieving the metadata or if the database does not support this feature.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.getMetaData() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.DatabaseMetaData.getMaxTablesInSelect() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class DatabaseHelper {
    public static int getMaxTablesInSelectStatement(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        
        try {
            DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
            int maxTables = metaData.getMaxTablesInSelect();
            if (maxTables < 0) {
                throw new SQLException("Database does not support retrieving maximum number of tables in SELECT statement");
            }
            return maxTables;
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Error retrieving metadata: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the `Connection` object. If the connection is closed, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message.

Next, the `getMetaData()` method is called inside a try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that may occur. If an exception is caught, a new `SQLException` is thrown with a message that includes the original exception's message.

Finally, the `getMaxTablesInSelect()` method is called on the `DatabaseMetaData` object, and the result is checked to ensure that it is not negative. If it is negative, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message. Otherwise, the maximum number of tables is returned.
