
Sure, here's an updated version of the `executePreparedStatement` method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the statement if it has exceeded the specified timeout:

```java
public void executePreparedStatement(PreparedStatement preparedStatement, int queryTimeout) throws SQLException {
    preparedStatement.setQueryTimeout(queryTimeout);
    try {
        preparedStatement.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            preparedStatement.cancel();
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method takes an additional parameter `queryTimeout` which specifies the maximum number of seconds that the statement should be allowed to run before timing out. The method sets this timeout using the `setQueryTimeout` method of the PreparedStatement object.

If the statement exceeds the specified timeout and the driver has attempted to cancel it, the method catches the resulting SQLTimeoutException and cancels the statement using the `cancel` method of the PreparedStatement object. If the exception is not a SQLTimeoutException, it is re-thrown to be handled by the calling code.

Note that this method now throws a SQLException, which includes the SQLTimeoutException if it occurs. The calling code should handle this exception appropriately.
