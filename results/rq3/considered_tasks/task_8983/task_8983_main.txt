Please write a java method that Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result.
Here is an example of a Java method that waits for a computation to complete and retrieves its result:

```
public static <T> T getResult(Future<T> future) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
    T result = future.get(); // waits for the computation to complete and retrieves the result
    return result;
}
```

This method takes a `Future` object as its parameter, which represents a computation that may not have completed yet. The `get()` method of the `Future` object blocks until the computation is complete and returns the result.

If the computation is interrupted or encounters an exception, the `get()` method will throw an `InterruptedException` or an `ExecutionException`, respectively. Therefore, the `getResult()` method also declares these exceptions in its signature.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the computation was cancelled for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw CancellationException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `getResult()` method that checks if the computation was cancelled and throws a `CancellationException` if it was:

```
public static <T> T getResult(Future<T> future) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, CancellationException {
    T result = future.get(); // waits for the computation to complete and retrieves the result
    if (future.isCancelled()) {
        throw new CancellationException("Computation was cancelled");
    }
    return result;
}
```

This version of the method first calls `future.get()` to wait for the computation to complete and retrieve the result. Then it checks if the computation was cancelled by calling `future.isCancelled()`. If it was, it throws a `CancellationException` with an appropriate message.

Note that the `CancellationException` is a checked exception, so it needs to be declared in the method signature along with `InterruptedException` and `ExecutionException`.

Please check if the computation was cancelled for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw CancellationException.
Please check if the computation threw an exception for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ExecutionException.
Please check if the current thread was interrupted while waiting for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InterruptedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `getResult()` method that checks for all the possible exceptions that can be thrown by `Future.get()`:

```
public static <T> T getResult(Future<T> future) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, CancellationException {
    try {
        T result = future.get(); // waits for the computation to complete and retrieves the result
        if (future.isCancelled()) {
            throw new CancellationException("Computation was cancelled");
        }
        return result;
    } catch (CancellationException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (ExecutionException e) {
        Throwable cause = e.getCause();
        if (cause instanceof RuntimeException) {
            throw (RuntimeException) cause;
        } else if (cause instanceof Error) {
            throw (Error) cause;
        } else {
            throw new ExecutionException(cause);
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        future.cancel(true); // cancel the computation if the thread was interrupted
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This version of the method first calls `future.get()` to wait for the computation to complete and retrieve the result. Then it checks if the computation was cancelled by calling `future.isCancelled()`. If it was, it throws a `CancellationException` with an appropriate message.

If the computation threw an exception, the method checks the type of the exception and rethrows it as a `RuntimeException` or an `Error` if it is one of those types, or as an `ExecutionException` otherwise.

Finally, if the current thread was interrupted while waiting for the computation to complete, the method cancels the computation by calling `future.cancel(true)` and throws an `InterruptedException`.
