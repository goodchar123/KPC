List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
The Java JDK methods used in the method above are:

1. `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()` - This method waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result.
2. `java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException` - This exception is thrown when an error occurs during the execution of the computation.
3. `java.lang.InterruptedException` - This exception is thrown when a thread is interrupted while waiting for the computation to complete.

 + From response, we get: ['java.util.concurrent.Future.get()', 'java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException', 'java.lang.InterruptedException']

Is the CancellationException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ExecutionException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `ExecutionException` is declared in the method signature and can be thrown by the `get()` method, so it is being handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the InterruptedException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `InterruptedException` is declared in the method signature and can be thrown by the `get()` method, so it is being handled or caught in the code snippet.

1. `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()`
2. `java.util.concurrent.Future.isCancelled()`
3. `java.util.concurrent.CancellationException.CancellationException(String)`

 + From response, we get: ['java.util.concurrent.Future.get()', 'java.util.concurrent.Future.isCancelled()', 'java.util.concurrent.CancellationException.CancellationException(String)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the CancellationException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `CancellationException` is not handled or caught for `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()` in the code snippet. It is only thrown if the computation was cancelled, but it is not caught or handled within the `getResult()` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ExecutionException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `ExecutionException` is not handled or caught for `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()` in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature and can be thrown if the computation throws an exception, but it is not caught or handled within the `getResult()` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the InterruptedException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `InterruptedException` is not handled or caught for `java.util.concurrent.Future.get()` in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature and can be thrown if the thread waiting for the computation to complete is interrupted, but it is not caught or handled within the `getResult()` method.
