Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static Temporal adjustToThisYear(Temporal temporal) {
    try {
        return temporal.with(ChronoField.YEAR, LocalDate.now().getYear());
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Field cannot be set", e);
    } catch (UnsupportedTemporalTypeException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException("Field is not supported", e);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred");
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the requested checks for exceptions that may occur when using the `with` method to set the year field. If the field cannot be set, a `DateTimeException` is thrown with a message indicating that the field cannot be set. If the field is not supported, an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` is thrown with a message indicating that the field is not supported. If numeric overflow occurs, an `ArithmeticException` is thrown with a message indicating that numeric overflow occurred.
