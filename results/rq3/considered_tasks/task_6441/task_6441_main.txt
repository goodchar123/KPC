Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this time with the specified amount added.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given time with the specified amount added:

```java
public static LocalTime addTime(LocalTime time, Duration duration) {
    return time.plus(duration);
}
```

This method takes in a `LocalTime` object and a `Duration` object as parameters. It then returns a new `LocalTime` object that is the result of adding the specified duration to the given time. The original time object is not modified, as the method returns a copy of it with the added duration.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the addition cannot be made for java.time.LocalTime.plus(java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.LocalTime.plus(java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for potential exceptions:

```java
public static LocalTime addTime(LocalTime time, Duration duration) {
    try {
        return time.plus(duration);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        return null;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        return null;
    }
}
```

This method still takes in a `LocalTime` object and a `Duration` object as parameters. It attempts to add the specified duration to the given time using the `plus()` method. However, it now includes two catch blocks to handle potential exceptions.

The first catch block catches a `DateTimeException`, which is thrown if the addition cannot be made. In this case, the method prints an error message and returns `null`.

The second catch block catches an `ArithmeticException`, which is thrown if numeric overflow occurs during the addition. Again, the method prints an error message and returns `null`.

By including these catch blocks, the method can handle potential exceptions and provide more informative error messages.
