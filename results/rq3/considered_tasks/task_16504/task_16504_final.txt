Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks if the current thread is the owner of the object's monitor before calling `notify()`, and throws an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if it is not:

```
public void signal() {
    synchronized(this) {
        if (!Thread.holdsLock(this)) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Current thread is not the owner of this object's monitor");
        }
        this.notify();
    }
}
```

The `Thread.holdsLock(this)` method is used to check if the current thread holds the lock on the object's monitor. If it does not, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is thrown with an appropriate error message. If the current thread does hold the lock, the `notify()` method is called on the object to wake up any waiting threads.
