Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned:

```java
public void setCause(Throwable throwable, Throwable cause) {
    if (throwable == cause) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("A throwable cannot be its own cause.");
    }
    if (throwable.getCause() != null || throwable.getStackTrace().length > 0) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("The cause of this throwable has already been set or it was not created with Throwable(Throwable) or Throwable(String,Throwable).");
    }
    throwable.initCause(cause);
}
```

This method first checks if the `throwable` object is the same as the `cause` object. If they are the same, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that a throwable cannot be its own cause.

Next, it checks if the `throwable` object already has a cause or if it has a non-empty stack trace. If either of these conditions is true, it throws an `IllegalStateException` with a message indicating that the cause of the throwable has already been set or that it was not created with `Throwable(Throwable)` or `Throwable(String,Throwable)`.

If both checks pass, the method initializes the cause of the throwable to the specified value using the `initCause()` method.

You can call this method in the same way as before:

```java
Throwable myThrowable = new Throwable("An
