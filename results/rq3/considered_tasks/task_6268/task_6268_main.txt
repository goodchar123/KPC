Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this ZonedDateTime with the hour-of-day altered.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given `ZonedDateTime` object with the hour-of-day altered:

```java
public static ZonedDateTime withHour(ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime, int hour) {
    return zonedDateTime.withHour(hour);
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the `ZonedDateTime` object to be modified, and the new hour-of-day value. It returns a new `ZonedDateTime` object with the same date, time zone, and minute-of-hour as the original, but with the hour-of-day set to the specified value.

For example, if you have a `ZonedDateTime` object representing 3:30 PM on January 1, 2022 in the US/Pacific time zone, and you want to create a new object with the hour set to 5, you could call the method like this:

```java
ZonedDateTime original = ZonedDateTime.of(2022, 1, 1, 15, 30, 0, 0, ZoneId.of("US/Pacific"));
ZonedDateTime modified = withHour(original, 5);
```

The `modified` object would represent 5:30 PM on January 1, 2022 in the same time zone.

Please check if the value of any field is out of range, or  if the day of month is invalid for the month year for java.time.ZonedDateTime.of(int,int,int,int,int,int,int,java.time.ZoneId) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Please check if the hour value is invalid for java.time.ZonedDateTime.withHour(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for out-of-range values and throws a `DateTimeException` if necessary:

```java
public static ZonedDateTime withHour(ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime, int hour) {
    try {
        return zonedDateTime.withHour(hour);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid hour value: " + hour, e);
    }
}
```

This method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `DateTimeException` that might be thrown by the `withHour()` method. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `DateTimeException` with a more informative error message that includes the invalid hour value.

Similarly, here's an updated version of the `ZonedDateTime.of()` method that checks for invalid day-of-month values:

```java
public static ZonedDateTime of(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute, int second, int nanoOfSecond, ZoneId zone) {
    try {
        return ZonedDateTime.of(year, month, dayOfMonth, hour, minute, second, nanoOfSecond, zone);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid date or time value: " + e.getMessage(), e);
    }
}
```

This method also uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `DateTimeException` that might be thrown by the `ZonedDateTime.of()` method. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `DateTimeException` with a more informative error message that includes the original exception message.
