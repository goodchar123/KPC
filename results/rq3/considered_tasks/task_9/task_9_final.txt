Sure, here's an updated version of the `queryNames` method that checks for a `CommunicationException` and throws an `IOException` if it occurs:

```java
import javax.management.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.rmi.ConnectException;
import java.util.Set;

public class MBeanServerConnectionHandler {
    
    public static Set<ObjectName> queryNames(MBeanServerConnection mbsc, ObjectName name, QueryExp query) throws IOException {
        try {
            return mbsc.queryNames(name, query);
        } catch (CommunicationException ce) {
            throw new IOException("A communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server.", ce);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new IOException(e);
        }
    }
    
}
```

This updated method catches a `CommunicationException` specifically and throws an `IOException` with a helpful error message. It also catches any other exceptions that may occur and re-throws them as an `IOException`. 

Note that I also added a catch block for `Exception` to handle any other unexpected exceptions that may occur. You may want to modify this catch block to handle specific exceptions as appropriate for your use case.
