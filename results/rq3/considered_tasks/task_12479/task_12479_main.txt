Please write a java method that Sets the value of a variable to the newValue, with memory semantics of setting as if the variable was declared non-volatile and non-final.
Here's an example Java method that sets the value of a variable to the newValue with non-volatile and non-final memory semantics:

```
public static void setVariableValue(Object variable, Object newValue) {
    Unsafe unsafe = Unsafe.getUnsafe();
    long offset = unsafe.objectFieldOffset(variable.getClass().getDeclaredFields()[0]);
    unsafe.putObject(variable, offset, newValue);
}
```

This method uses the `Unsafe` class to access the memory location of the variable and set its value to the new value. It assumes that the variable is an object and uses reflection to get the offset of its first field. Note that using `Unsafe` can be dangerous and should only be used by experienced developers who understand the risks involved.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If a security manager, s, is present and any of the          following conditions is met:           the caller's class loader is not the same as the          class loader of this class and invocation of          s.checkPermission method with          RuntimePermission("accessDeclaredMembers")          denies access to the declared fields within this class           the caller's class loader is not the same as or an          ancestor of the class loader for the current class and          invocation of s.checkPackageAccess() denies access to the package          of this class for java.lang.Class.getDeclaredFields() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the presence of a security manager and performs the security checks you described:

```
public static void setVariableValue(Object variable, Object newValue) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager s = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (s != null) {
        Class<?> callerClass = Reflection.getCallerClass();
        ClassLoader callerClassLoader = callerClass.getClassLoader();
        ClassLoader thisClassLoader = MyClass.class.getClassLoader();
        if (callerClassLoader != thisClassLoader &&
            !s.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("accessDeclaredMembers"))) {
            throw new SecurityException("Access to declared fields denied");
        }
        if (!callerClassLoader.equals(thisClassLoader) &&
            !callerClassLoader.isAncestorOf(thisClassLoader) &&
            !s.checkPackageAccess(MyClass.class.getPackage().getName())) {
            throw new SecurityException("Access to package denied");
        }
    }
    Unsafe unsafe = Unsafe.getUnsafe();
    long offset = unsafe.objectFieldOffset(variable.getClass().getDeclaredFields()[0]);
    unsafe.putObject(variable, offset, newValue);
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager is present. If so, it gets the caller's class loader and the class loader for the current class. It then performs two security checks:

1. If the caller's class loader is not the same as the class loader of this class and the security manager denies access to the declared fields, a `SecurityException` is thrown.
2. If the caller's class loader is not the same as or an ancestor of the class loader for the current class and the security manager denies access to the package of this class, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If both security checks pass, the method uses `Unsafe` to set the value of the variable to the new value.
