Please write a java method that Replaces the last element returned by next() or previous() with the specified element (optional operation).
Here's a Java method that replaces the last element returned by next() or previous() with the specified element:

```java
public void replaceLast(E element) {
    if (lastReturned == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No element has been returned yet");
    }
    lastReturned.setValue(element);
}
```

This assumes that you have a `ListIterator` object with a `lastReturned` field that holds the last element returned by `next()` or `previous()`. The `setValue()` method is used to set the value of the last returned element to the specified element. If no element has been returned yet, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the iteration has no next element for java.util.ListIterator.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if the iteration has no previous         element for java.util.ListIterator.previous() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the presence of next and previous elements and throws `NoSuchElementException` if they are not present:

```java
public void replaceLast(E element) {
    if (lastReturned == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No element has been returned yet");
    }
    if (!hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No next element");
    }
    if (!hasPrevious()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No previous element");
    }
    lastReturned.setValue(element);
}
```

This method now checks for the presence of next and previous elements using the `hasNext()` and `hasPrevious()` methods respectively. If either of these methods returns `false`, a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown with an appropriate message.
