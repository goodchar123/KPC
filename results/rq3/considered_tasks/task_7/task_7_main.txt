Please write a java method that Handles the method MBeanServerConnection.getObjectInstance(ObjectName).
Sure, here's an example Java method that handles the `MBeanServerConnection.getObjectInstance(ObjectName)` method:

```
import javax.management.MBeanServerConnection;
import javax.management.ObjectInstance;
import javax.management.ObjectName;

public class MBeanServerConnectionHandler {
    
    public ObjectInstance getObjectInstance(MBeanServerConnection mbsc, ObjectName objectName) throws Exception {
        ObjectInstance objectInstance = mbsc.getObjectInstance(objectName);
        return objectInstance;
    }
    
}
```

This method takes in an `MBeanServerConnection` object and an `ObjectName` object as parameters, and returns an `ObjectInstance` object. It calls the `getObjectInstance` method on the `MBeanServerConnection` object, passing in the `ObjectName` object, and returns the resulting `ObjectInstance` object. 

Note that this method throws an `Exception` if there is an error retrieving the `ObjectInstance` object. You may want to handle this exception in your code depending on your specific use case.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check The MBean specified is not registered in the MBean server. for javax.management.MBeanServerConnection.getObjectInstance(javax.management.ObjectName) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InstanceNotFoundException.
Please check A communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server. for javax.management.MBeanServerConnection.getObjectInstance(javax.management.ObjectName) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that handles the `MBeanServerConnection.getObjectInstance(ObjectName)` method and checks for `InstanceNotFoundException` and `IOException`:

```
import javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException;
import javax.management.MBeanServerConnection;
import javax.management.ObjectInstance;
import javax.management.ObjectName;
import java.io.IOException;

public class MBeanServerConnectionHandler {
    
    public ObjectInstance getObjectInstance(MBeanServerConnection mbsc, ObjectName objectName) throws InstanceNotFoundException, IOException {
        try {
            ObjectInstance objectInstance = mbsc.getObjectInstance(objectName);
            if (objectInstance == null) {
                throw new InstanceNotFoundException("The MBean specified is not registered in the MBean server.");
            }
            return objectInstance;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("A communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server.", e);
        }
    }
    
}
```

This updated method now checks for `InstanceNotFoundException` and `IOException` and throws them accordingly. If the `getObjectInstance` method returns `null`, indicating that the MBean is not registered in the MBean server, the method throws an `InstanceNotFoundException` with a message indicating the issue. If there is a communication problem with the MBean server, the method throws an `IOException` with a message indicating the issue and the original exception as the cause.
