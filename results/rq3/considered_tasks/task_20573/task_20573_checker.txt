List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.sql.Blob.length()`
2. `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.<init>(java.lang.String)`
3. `java.sql.Blob.getBytes(long, int)`
4. `java.io.ByteArrayInputStream.<init>(byte[])`

 + From response, we get: ['java.sql.Blob.length()', 'java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.<init>(java.lang.String)', 'java.sql.Blob.getBytes(long,int)', 'java.io.ByteArrayInputStream.<init>(byte[])']

Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Blob.length() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SQLException` is not handled or caught for `java.sql.Blob.length()` in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLFeatureNotSupportedException handled or caught for java.sql.Blob.length() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is not handled or caught for `java.sql.Blob.length()` in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Blob.getBytes(long,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SQLException` is not handled or caught for `java.sql.Blob.getBytes(long, int)` in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLFeatureNotSupportedException handled or caught for java.sql.Blob.getBytes(long,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.

Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Blob.length() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block that surrounds the call to `blob.length()`. If an exception is thrown, the method throws a new `SQLException` with a message indicating that there was an error accessing the Blob length, and includes the original exception as the cause.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLFeatureNotSupportedException handled or caught for java.sql.Blob.length() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is handled and thrown in the `if` statement that checks if the JDBC driver supports the `Blob.length()` method. If the driver does not support the method, the method throws a new `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with a message indicating that the method is not supported by the driver.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Blob.getBytes(long,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block that surrounds the call to `blob.getBytes(pos, (int)length)`. If an exception is thrown, the method throws a new `SQLException` with a message indicating that there was an error accessing the Blob value, and includes the original exception as the cause.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLFeatureNotSupportedException handled or caught for java.sql.Blob.getBytes(long,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is handled and thrown in the `if` statement that checks if the JDBC driver supports the `Blob.getBytes()` method. If the driver does not support the method, the method throws a new `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with a message indicating that the method is not supported by the driver.
