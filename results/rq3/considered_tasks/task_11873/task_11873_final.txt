Sure, here's an updated version of the `compress` method that checks for an `IOException` when writing to the output stream:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.util.zip.Deflater;

public class Compressor {
    
    private Deflater deflater;
    private byte[] buffer;
    
    public Compressor() {
        deflater = new Deflater();
        buffer = new byte[1024];
    }
    
    public void compress(byte[] data, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
        deflater.setInput(data);
        deflater.finish();
        while (!deflater.finished()) {
            int count = deflater.deflate(buffer);
            try {
                out.write(buffer, 0, count);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error writing compressed data to output stream", e);
            }
        }
        deflater.reset();
    }
}
```

In this updated version, the `write` method call is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches any `IOException` that may occur. If an `IOException` is caught, a new `IOException` is thrown with a more descriptive error message that includes the original exception as the cause. This way, the caller of the `compress` method can handle the exception appropriately.
