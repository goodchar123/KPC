Please write a java method that Writes next block of compressed data to the output stream.
Here's an example Java method that writes the next block of compressed data to the output stream:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.util.zip.Deflater;

public class Compressor {
    
    private Deflater deflater;
    private byte[] buffer;
    
    public Compressor() {
        deflater = new Deflater();
        buffer = new byte[1024];
    }
    
    public void compress(byte[] data, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
        deflater.setInput(data);
        deflater.finish();
        while (!deflater.finished()) {
            int count = deflater.deflate(buffer);
            out.write(buffer, 0, count);
        }
        deflater.reset();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `compress` method takes in a byte array of uncompressed data and an output stream to write the compressed data to. The method first sets the input data for the `Deflater` object, then calls `finish` to indicate that no more input data will be added. The method then loops through the compressed data, writing it to the output stream in blocks of 1024 bytes until the `Deflater` object indicates that it has finished compressing all the data. Finally, the `Deflater` object is reset to prepare for the next block of data to be compressed.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. In particular,             an IOException is thrown if the output             stream is closed. for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `compress` method that checks for an `IOException` when writing to the output stream:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.util.zip.Deflater;

public class Compressor {
    
    private Deflater deflater;
    private byte[] buffer;
    
    public Compressor() {
        deflater = new Deflater();
        buffer = new byte[1024];
    }
    
    public void compress(byte[] data, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
        deflater.setInput(data);
        deflater.finish();
        while (!deflater.finished()) {
            int count = deflater.deflate(buffer);
            try {
                out.write(buffer, 0, count);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error writing compressed data to output stream", e);
            }
        }
        deflater.reset();
    }
}
```

In this updated version, the `write` method call is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches any `IOException` that may occur. If an `IOException` is caught, a new `IOException` is thrown with a more descriptive error message that includes the original exception as the cause. This way, the caller of the `compress` method can handle the exception appropriately.
