Please write a java method that Clears all warnings reported for this Connection object.
Here's a Java method that clears all warnings reported for a Connection object:

```java
public void clearConnectionWarnings(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    conn.clearWarnings();
}
```

This method takes a Connection object as a parameter and calls the `clearWarnings()` method on it to clear any warnings that have been reported for the connection. If there are no warnings, this method has no effect. If there are warnings, they will be cleared and can no longer be retrieved using the `getWarnings()` method. 

Note that this method may throw a SQLException if there is a problem clearing the warnings. You may want to handle this exception in your code to ensure that the warnings are properly cleared.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.clearWarnings() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a database access error or a closed connection and throws a SQLException if either of those conditions are met:

```java
public void clearConnectionWarnings(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    try {
        conn.clearWarnings();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getSQLState().equals("08003") || e.getSQLState().equals("08006")) {
            throw new SQLException("Cannot clear warnings: connection is closed", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any SQLException that may be thrown by the `clearWarnings()` method. If an SQLException is caught, it checks the SQLState of the exception to determine whether it was caused by a closed connection or a database access error. If either of those conditions are met, it throws a new SQLException with a more informative error message. Otherwise, it re-throws the original exception.

By doing this, the method provides more detailed information about the cause of the error, which can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting.
