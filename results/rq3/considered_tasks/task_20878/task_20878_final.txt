
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a database access error or a closed connection and throws a SQLException if either of those conditions are met:

```java
public void clearConnectionWarnings(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    try {
        conn.clearWarnings();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getSQLState().equals("08003") || e.getSQLState().equals("08006")) {
            throw new SQLException("Cannot clear warnings: connection is closed", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any SQLException that may be thrown by the `clearWarnings()` method. If an SQLException is caught, it checks the SQLState of the exception to determine whether it was caused by a closed connection or a database access error. If either of those conditions are met, it throws a new SQLException with a more informative error message. Otherwise, it re-throws the original exception.

By doing this, the method provides more detailed information about the cause of the error, which can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting.
