Please write a java method that Causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled or interrupted, or the specified waiting time elapses.
Here is an example Java method that causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled or interrupted, or the specified waiting time elapses:

```
public void waitForSignal(long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
    synchronized(this) {
        this.wait(timeout);
    }
}
```

This method takes a `long` parameter `timeout` which specifies the maximum time to wait in milliseconds. The method uses the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that only one thread can wait on the object at a time. The `wait()` method is then called on the object with the specified timeout. If the thread is interrupted while waiting, an `InterruptedException` will be thrown.

Please check if the current thread is not               the owner of this object's monitor. for java.lang.Object.notify() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks if the current thread is the owner of the object's monitor before calling `notify()`, and throws an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if it is not:

```
public void signal() {
    synchronized(this) {
        if (!Thread.holdsLock(this)) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Current thread is not the owner of this object's monitor");
        }
        this.notify();
    }
}
```

The `Thread.holdsLock(this)` method is used to check if the current thread holds the lock on the object's monitor. If it does not, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is thrown with an appropriate error message. If the current thread does hold the lock, the `notify()` method is called on the object to wake up any waiting threads.
