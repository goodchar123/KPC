Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for numeric overflow when subtracting days from a `Duration` object:

```java
public Duration subtractDays(Duration duration, long days) {
    try {
        return duration.minusDays(days);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred when subtracting days from duration.");
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may be thrown when subtracting days from the `Duration` object. If an `ArithmeticException` is caught, it means that a numeric overflow has occurred, and the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message.

By doing this, the method provides a more informative error message to the caller, indicating that a numeric overflow occurred when subtracting days from the `Duration` object.
