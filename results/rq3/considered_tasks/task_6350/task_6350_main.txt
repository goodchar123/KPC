Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this duration with the specified duration in standard 24 hour days subtracted.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a duration with the specified duration in standard 24 hour days subtracted:

```java
public Duration subtractDays(Duration duration, long days) {
    return duration.minusDays(days);
}
```

This method takes in two parameters: the first parameter is the duration that you want to subtract days from, and the second parameter is the number of days that you want to subtract.

The `minusDays()` method is a built-in method in the `Duration` class that subtracts the specified number of days from the duration. This method returns a new `Duration` object that represents the result of the subtraction.

By returning this new `Duration` object, the original `Duration` object is not modified, and a copy of the original `Duration` object with the specified number of days subtracted is returned instead.

Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.Duration.minusDays(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for numeric overflow when subtracting days from a `Duration` object:

```java
public Duration subtractDays(Duration duration, long days) {
    try {
        return duration.minusDays(days);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred when subtracting days from duration.");
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may be thrown when subtracting days from the `Duration` object. If an `ArithmeticException` is caught, it means that a numeric overflow has occurred, and the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message.

By doing this, the method provides a more informative error message to the caller, indicating that a numeric overflow occurred when subtracting days from the `Duration` object.
