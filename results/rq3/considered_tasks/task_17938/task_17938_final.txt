You're right, it's important to handle those exceptions when calling the `remove()` method on a `List`. Here's an updated version of the method that includes those checks:

```java
public static List<String> removeAttributeValue(List<String> attributeValues, String valueToRemove) {
    if (attributeValues == null || attributeValues.isEmpty()) {
        return attributeValues;
    }
    
    List<String> updatedAttributeValues = new ArrayList<>(attributeValues);
    
    try {
        if (!updatedAttributeValues.remove(valueToRemove)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Value not found in list");
        }
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Value is of incompatible type for this list", e);
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Value is null and this list does not permit null elements", e);
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Remove operation is not supported by this list", e);
    }
    
    return updatedAttributeValues;
}
```

This version of the method first creates a new list with the same elements as the original list, as before. It then attempts to remove the specified value from the list using the `remove()` method, and catches any exceptions that may be thrown. If the value is not found in the list, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the value was not found. If the value is of an incompatible type for the list, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the value is of an incompatible type, and includes the original exception as a cause. If the value is null and the list does not permit null elements, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the value is null and the list does not permit null elements, and includes the original exception as a cause. If the remove operation is not supported by the list, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the remove operation is not supported, and includes the original exception as a cause.

Note that this version of the method assumes that the list is modifiable. If the list is unmodifiable, attempting to remove an element will result in an `UnsupportedOperationException`. In that case, you would need to modify the method to handle that exception as well.
