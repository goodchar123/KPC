Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this year-month with the specified amount added.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given year-month with the specified amount added:

```java
public YearMonth addMonths(YearMonth yearMonth, long monthsToAdd) {
    return yearMonth.plusMonths(monthsToAdd);
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the `YearMonth` object to which the months will be added, and the number of months to add. It then returns a new `YearMonth` object that is a copy of the original with the specified number of months added.

Note that this method uses the `plusMonths()` method provided by the `YearMonth` class to add the specified number of months to the original `YearMonth` object. This method returns a new `YearMonth` object that represents the result of the addition.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the result exceeds the supported range for java.time.YearMonth.plusMonths(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the result exceeds the supported range for `java.time.YearMonth.plusMonths(long)` and throws a `DateTimeException` if it does:

```java
public YearMonth addMonths(YearMonth yearMonth, long monthsToAdd) {
    YearMonth result = yearMonth.plusMonths(monthsToAdd);
    if (result.isAfter(YearMonth.MAX) || result.isBefore(YearMonth.MIN)) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Result exceeds supported range for YearMonth");
    }
    return result;
}
```

This method first calls `plusMonths()` to add the specified number of months to the original `YearMonth` object and stores the result in a new `YearMonth` object called `result`. It then checks if `result` is after the maximum supported `YearMonth` value or before the minimum supported `YearMonth` value using the `isAfter()` and `isBefore()` methods provided by the `YearMonth` class. If `result` is outside the supported range, a `DateTimeException` is thrown with an appropriate error message. Otherwise, the method returns `result`.

This updated method ensures that the result of the addition is within the supported range for `YearMonth` objects, and provides an appropriate error message if it is not.
