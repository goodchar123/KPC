Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the `IllegalStateException` when calling `getValue()` on a removed entry:

```
public static <K, V> boolean containsValue(Map<K, V> map, V value) {
    for (Map.Entry<K, V> entry : map.entrySet()) {
        try {
            if (entry.getValue().equals(value)) {
                return true;
            }
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            // Entry has been removed from the backing map
            // Do nothing and continue to the next entry
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch the `IllegalStateException` that may be thrown if an entry has been removed from the backing map. If this exception is caught, the method simply continues to the next entry without doing anything. If no match is found, the method returns false.
