Please write a java method that Removes the remote object, obj, from the RMI runtime.
Here is an example Java method that removes a remote object from the RMI runtime:

```
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class MyRemoteObject extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteInterface {
    
    public MyRemoteObject() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }
    
    public void removeRemoteObject() throws RemoteException {
        UnicastRemoteObject.unexportObject(this, true);
    }
    
    // other methods of the remote object
    
}
```

In this example, the `removeRemoteObject()` method calls the static `unexportObject()` method of the `UnicastRemoteObject` class to remove the remote object from the RMI runtime. The first parameter of this method is the remote object to be removed, and the second parameter specifies whether to forcibly unexport the object if it is still in use by other clients. 

Note that the remote object must extend the `UnicastRemoteObject` class and implement the remote interface (`MyRemoteInterface` in this example) to be able to be exported and removed from the RMI runtime.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the remote object is not currently exported for java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject.unexportObject(java.rmi.Remote,boolean) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchObjectException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `removeRemoteObject()` method that checks if the remote object is currently exported before attempting to unexport it. If the object is not exported, it throws a `NoSuchObjectException`:

```
import java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class MyRemoteObject extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteInterface {
    
    public MyRemoteObject() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }
    
    public void removeRemoteObject() throws RemoteException, NoSuchObjectException {
        if (UnicastRemoteObject.unexportObject(this, true)) {
            System.out.println("Remote object successfully unexported.");
        } else {
            throw new NoSuchObjectException("Remote object not found in registry.");
        }
    }
    
    // other methods of the remote object
    
}
```

In this updated version, the `unexportObject()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the object was successfully unexported. If the method returns `true`, the remote object was successfully removed from the RMI runtime and a message is printed to the console. If the method returns `false`, it means that the remote object was not found in the registry and a `NoSuchObjectException` is thrown.
