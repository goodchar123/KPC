Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error when closing the `Writer` and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public void writeStringToClob(SerialClob clob, String str, long pos) throws SQLException, IOException {
    // Convert the String to a character array
    char[] charArray = str.toCharArray();
    
    // Get a Writer object for the CLOB
    Writer writer = clob.setCharacterStream(pos);
    
    // Write the character array to the CLOB
    writer.write(charArray);
    
    // Close the Writer and check for I/O errors
    try {
        writer.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error closing Writer: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method now throws an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs when closing the `Writer`. The `close()` method is called inside a `try` block, and any `IOException` that is thrown is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.
