Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the later of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given date-time object with the zone offset changed to the later of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap:

```java
import java.time.*;
import java.time.temporal.*;

public static ZonedDateTime adjustForOverlap(ZonedDateTime dateTime) {
    ZoneId zone = dateTime.getZone();
    LocalDateTime localDateTime = dateTime.toLocalDateTime();
    ZoneOffsetTransition transition = zone.getRules().getTransition(localDateTime);
    if (transition != null && transition.isOverlap()) {
        ZoneOffset laterOffset = transition.getOffsetAfter();
        return dateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap().withOffsetSameInstant(laterOffset);
    }
    return dateTime;
}
```

This method takes a `ZonedDateTime` object as input and returns a new `ZonedDateTime` object with the zone offset adjusted for any local time-line overlap. 

First, we get the `ZoneId` and `LocalDateTime` from the input `ZonedDateTime`. Then, we use the `ZoneRules` of the zone to get the `ZoneOffsetTransition` at the local date-time. If the transition is not null and is an overlap (i.e., there are two valid offsets at the same local time), we get the later offset and use the `withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()` method to adjust the date-time to the later offset. Finally, we use the `withOffsetSameInstant()` method to adjust the offset of the date-time while keeping the instant the same.

If there is no overlap at the local date-time, the method simply returns the input `ZonedDateTime` object.

Please check if no rules are available for this ID for java.time.ZoneId.getRules() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ZoneRulesException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks if there are no rules available for the given `ZoneId` and throws a `ZoneRulesException` if that's the case:

```java
import java.time.*;
import java.time.temporal.*;

public static ZonedDateTime adjustForOverlap(ZonedDateTime dateTime) {
    ZoneId zone = dateTime.getZone();
    if (!zone.getRules().isFixedOffset()) {
        LocalDateTime localDateTime = dateTime.toLocalDateTime();
        ZoneOffsetTransition transition = zone.getRules().getTransition(localDateTime);
        if (transition != null && transition.isOverlap()) {
            ZoneOffset laterOffset = transition.getOffsetAfter();
            return dateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap().withOffsetSameInstant(laterOffset);
        }
    }
    return dateTime;
}
```

In this updated version of the method, we first check if the `ZoneRules` for the given `ZoneId` are fixed offset using the `isFixedOffset()` method. If they are fixed offset, we don't need to adjust for any local time-line overlap, so we simply return the input `ZonedDateTime` object.

If the `ZoneRules` are not fixed offset, we proceed to get the `LocalDateTime` and `ZoneOffsetTransition` as before. If there is an overlap at the local date-time, we get the later offset and adjust the date-time using the `withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()` and `withOffsetSameInstant()` methods.

However, if there are no rules available for the given `ZoneId`, the `getRules()` method will throw a `ZoneRulesException`. We don't need to explicitly throw this exception ourselves, as it will be thrown automatically by the `getRules()` method.

                return dateTime.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap().withOffsetSameInstant(laterOffset);
            }
        }
    } catch (ZoneRulesException e) {
        throw e;
    }
    return dateTime;
}
```

In this updated version of the method, we first try to get the `ZoneRules` for the given `ZoneId` and check if they are fixed offset using the `isFixedOffset()` method. If they are fixed offset, we don't need to adjust for any local time-line overlap, so we simply return the input `ZonedDateTime` object.

However, if there are no rules available for the given `ZoneId`, the `getRules()` method will throw a `ZoneRulesException`. In this case, we catch the exception and re-throw it to indicate that there are no rules available for the given `ZoneId`.
