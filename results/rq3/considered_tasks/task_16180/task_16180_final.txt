Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for I/O errors when flushing both the `OutputStream` and `CipherOutputStream` objects:

```java
public void flushOutputStream(CipherOutputStream cos) throws IOException {
    try {
        cos.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error flushing CipherOutputStream", e);
    }
    OutputStream os = cos.getOutputStream();
    try {
        os.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error flushing OutputStream", e);
    }
}
```

This method first calls the `flush()` method on the `CipherOutputStream` object and checks for any `IOException` that may occur. If an `IOException` is caught, it is re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.

Next, the method calls the `getOutputStream()` method on the `CipherOutputStream` object to get the underlying `OutputStream` object and calls its `flush()` method. Again, any `IOException` that may occur is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.

By checking for I/O errors when flushing both the `CipherOutputStream` and `OutputStream` objects, this method provides more robust error handling and helps to ensure that any errors are properly reported and handled.
