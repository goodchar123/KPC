You're right again, it's important to handle any potential `IOException` that may occur when calling `read()` on the `InputStream`. Here's the updated code snippet that checks for an `IOException` and throws it if one occurs:

```java
public int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    // Get the number of bytes that can be read without blocking
    int available = 0;
    try {
        available = inputStream.available();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error getting available bytes from input stream", e);
    }

    // If the available bytes is 0 and the end of the stream has not been reached,
    // try to read a single byte to see if it blocks
    if (available == 0) {
        int readByte = 0;
        try {
            readByte = inputStream.read();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading from input stream", e);
        }
        if (readByte == -1) {
            // End of stream has been reached
            return 0;
        } else {
            // One byte was read without blocking, so there must be more available
            available = 1 + inputStream.available();
        }
    }

    return available;
}
```

In this updated version, we wrap the call to `inputStream.read()` in a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur. If an `IOException` is caught, we re-throw it with a more descriptive error message.
