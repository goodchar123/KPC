
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the input stream reaches the end before reading two bytes:

```java
public short readNextAttribute(DataInputStream stream) throws IOException {
    if (stream.available() < 2) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return stream.readShort();
}
```

This method first checks if the number of bytes available in the input stream is less than 2 using the `available()` method of the `DataInputStream` class. If there are less than 2 bytes available, it means that the end of the stream has been reached, so an `EOFException` is thrown.

If there are at least 2 bytes available, the method reads the next two bytes from the stream using the `readShort()` method and returns them as a short value.
