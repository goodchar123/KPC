Please write a java method that Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a short in the Java programming language.
Here's a Java method that reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a short:

```java
public short readNextAttribute(DataInputStream stream) throws IOException {
    return stream.readShort();
}
```

This method takes a `DataInputStream` object as a parameter and uses its `readShort()` method to read the next two bytes from the stream and return them as a short value. If an error occurs while reading from the stream, an `IOException` is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this input stream reaches the end before               reading two bytes. for java.io.DataInputStream.readShort() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw EOFException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the input stream reaches the end before reading two bytes:

```java
public short readNextAttribute(DataInputStream stream) throws IOException {
    if (stream.available() < 2) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return stream.readShort();
}
```

This method first checks if the number of bytes available in the input stream is less than 2 using the `available()` method of the `DataInputStream` class. If there are less than 2 bytes available, it means that the end of the stream has been reached, so an `EOFException` is thrown.

If there are at least 2 bytes available, the method reads the next two bytes from the stream using the `readShort()` method and returns them as a short value.
