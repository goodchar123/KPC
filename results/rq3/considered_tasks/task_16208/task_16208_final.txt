Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes the necessary exception handling:

```java
import javax.crypto.*;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

public static byte[] encryptOrDecrypt(byte[] data, byte[] key, int mode) throws Exception {
    if (key == null || key.length != 16) {
        throw new InvalidKeyException("Invalid key length. Key must be 16 bytes long.");
    }
    String transformation = "AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding";
    if (!Cipher.isAvailable(transformation)) {
        throw new NoSuchAlgorithmException("Invalid transformation: " + transformation);
    }
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(transformation);
    SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(key, "AES");
    cipher.init(mode, secretKeySpec);
    return cipher.doFinal(data);
}
```

This updated method includes the following exception handling:

- If the key is null or not 16 bytes long, an `InvalidKeyException` is thrown.
- If the transformation is not available, a `NoSuchAlgorithmException` is thrown.
- If the cipher cannot be initialized with the given key, an `InvalidKeyException` is thrown.
- If the cipher mode is not supported, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown.
- If the cipher is not in the correct state, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.
- If the input data is not a multiple of the block size, an `IllegalBlockSizeException` is thrown.
- If the padding is incorrect, a `BadPaddingException` is thrown.
- If the authentication tag is incorrect in an AEAD mode, an `AEADBadTagException` is thrown.

By including this exception handling, you can ensure that your code is robust and handles errors gracefully.
