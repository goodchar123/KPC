Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks for errors and throws appropriate exceptions:

```
public void parseXML(Reader reader) throws XMLStreamException, FactoryConfigurationError {
    XMLInputFactory factory = null;
    try {
        factory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
    } catch (FactoryConfigurationError e) {
        // Throw the exception if an instance of the factory cannot be loaded
        throw new FactoryConfigurationError("Unable to load XMLInputFactory", e);
    }
    XMLEventReader eventReader = null;
    try {
        eventReader = factory.createXMLEventReader(new StAXSource(factory.createXMLStreamReader(reader)));
    } catch (XMLStreamException e) {
        // Throw the exception if an error occurs while creating the event reader
        throw new XMLStreamException("Error creating XMLEventReader", e);
    }

    // Attempt to set the system identifier explicitly
    StAXSource source = new StAXSource(eventReader);
    try {
        source.setSystemId("http://example.com/myfile.xml");
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        // Throw the exception if setSystemId() is not supported by the StAXSource
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("setSystemId() is not supported by this StAXSource", e);
    }

    try {
        // This will throw an exception if createXMLEventReader() is not supported by the factory
        eventReader = factory.createXMLEventReader(source);
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        // Throw the exception if createXMLEventReader() is not supported by the factory
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("createXMLEventReader() is not supported by this XMLInputFactory", e);
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first attempt to create an instance of the `XMLInputFactory` using `XMLInputFactory.newInstance()`. If this fails and throws a `FactoryConfigurationError`, we catch the exception and re-throw it with a more descriptive error message.

Next, we attempt to create an `XMLEventReader` using the factory and a `StAXSource` created from the reader. If an error occurs while creating the event reader, we catch the `XMLStreamException` and re-throw it with a more descriptive error message.

We then attempt to set the system identifier explicitly using `StAXSource.setSystemId()`. If this method is not supported by the `StAXSource`, we catch the `UnsupportedOperationException` and re-throw it with a more descriptive error message.

Finally, we attempt to create a new `XMLEventReader` using the `StAXSource` and the factory's `createXMLEventReader()` method. If this method is not supported by the factory, we catch the `UnsupportedOperationException` and re-throw it with a more descriptive error message.
