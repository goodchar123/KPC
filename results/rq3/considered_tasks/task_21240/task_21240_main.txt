Please write a java method that Updates the designated column with a boolean value.
Sure, here's an example Java method that updates a designated column with a boolean value:

```java
public void updateBooleanColumn(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, boolean value, int id) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setBoolean(1, value);
        pstmt.setInt(2, id);
        pstmt.executeUpdate();
    }
}
```

This method takes in a `Connection` object, the name of the table to update, the name of the column to update, the boolean value to set, and the ID of the row to update. It then constructs an SQL statement using these parameters and executes it using a `PreparedStatement`. The `setBoolean()` method is used to set the boolean value in the prepared statement. If the update is successful, the method will return without throwing an exception. If there is an error, a `SQLException` will be thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the setQueryTimeout method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running Statement for java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLTimeoutException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the statement if it has exceeded the timeout value:

```java
public void updateBooleanColumn(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, boolean value, int id, int timeoutSeconds) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setBoolean(1, value);
        pstmt.setInt(2, id);
        pstmt.setQueryTimeout(timeoutSeconds);
        int rowsUpdated = pstmt.executeUpdate();
        if (rowsUpdated == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("No rows were updated");
        }
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        // Attempt to cancel the statement if it has exceeded the timeout value
        PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
        try {
            pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("KILL QUERY ?");
            pstmt.setLong(1, ((JDBC4PreparedStatement) pstmt).getQueryTimeoutKiller().getThreadId());
            pstmt.executeUpdate();
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            // Log or handle the exception as needed
        } finally {
            if (pstmt != null) {
                pstmt.close();
            }
        }
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `timeoutSeconds` which specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for the update to complete before timing out. It sets the query timeout on the prepared statement using the `setQueryTimeout()` method.

If the update completes successfully within the timeout period, the method returns normally. If the update takes longer than the specified timeout, a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown. In this case, the method attempts to cancel the statement by executing a `KILL QUERY` command on the database. If the cancellation is successful, the exception is re-thrown. If the cancellation fails, the exception is still thrown but the original statement may continue to run on the database.
