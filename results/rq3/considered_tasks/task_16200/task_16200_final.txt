Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes both checks:

```java
public byte[] process(byte[] data) throws IllegalStateException {
    if (cipher == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cipher not initialized");
    }
    try {
        int outputSize = cipher.getOutputSize(data.length);
        if (outputSize > MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Output size too large");
        }
        return cipher.update(data);
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Error processing data", e);
    }
}
```

This version first checks if the cipher is null, and throws an exception if it hasn't been initialized. Then, it tries to get the output size of the cipher for the given input data length. If the output size is too large, it throws an exception. If everything checks out, it calls the `update` method on the cipher object to process the data.

We also added a catch block to handle any other exceptions that might occur during the processing of the data. If an exception occurs, we throw a new `IllegalStateException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while processing the data, along with the original exception as the cause.

By including these checks, we can ensure that the cipher is in the correct state before processing any data, and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
