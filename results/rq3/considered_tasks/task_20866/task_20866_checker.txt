Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.isClosed() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLException` is not explicitly caught or handled for `java.sql.Connection.isClosed()` in the code snippet, but it is implicitly handled by the `throws SQLException` clause in the method signature. This means that any `SQLException` thrown by `isClosed()` will be propagated up the call stack and ultimately handled by the calling code.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.getAutoCommit() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SQLException` is not explicitly caught or handled for `java.sql.Connection.getAutoCommit()` in the code snippet. If an `SQLException` is thrown by this method, it will be propagated up the call stack and ultimately handled by the calling code.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.commit() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLException` is caught and handled for `java.sql.Connection.commit()` in the code snippet. If an `SQLException` is thrown by this method, it will be caught by the `catch` block and re-thrown as a new `SQLException` with the message "Error committing changes" and the original exception as the cause.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SQLException handled or caught for java.sql.Connection.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `SQLException` is caught and handled for `java.sql.Connection.close()` in the code snippet. If an `SQLException` is thrown by this method, it will be caught by the `catch` block and re-thrown as a new `SQLException` with the message "Error closing connection" and the original exception as the cause.
