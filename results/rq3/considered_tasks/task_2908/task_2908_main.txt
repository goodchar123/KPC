Please write a java method that Creates a future for a documentation task with the given components and arguments.
Sure, here's an example Java method that creates a future for a documentation task:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class DocumentationTask {
    public static Future<String> createDocumentationTask(String component, String[] arguments) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<String> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            // Perform documentation task here using component and arguments
            // Return the result as a String
            return "Documentation task completed for " + component;
        });
        executor.shutdown();
        return future;
    }
}
```

This method takes in a component and an array of arguments as parameters, and returns a `Future<String>` object that represents the result of the documentation task. The task is performed using a single-threaded executor, which ensures that the task is executed sequentially and not concurrently with other tasks. Once the task is completed, the result is returned as a String. Finally, the executor is shut down to release any resources it may be holding.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the task cannot be         scheduled for execution for java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService.submit(java.util.concurrent.Callable) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw RejectedExecutionException.
Please check if the task is null for java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService.submit(java.util.concurrent.Callable) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if a security manager exists and         shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate         threads that the caller is not permitted to modify         because it does not hold RuntimePermission("modifyThread"),         or the security manager's checkAccess method         denies access. for java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService.shutdown() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error handling:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class DocumentationTask {
    public static Future<String> createDocumentationTask(String component, String[] arguments) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<String> future = null;
        try {
            future = executor.submit(() -> {
                // Perform documentation task here using component and arguments
                // Return the result as a String
                return "Documentation task completed for " + component;
            });
        } catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task cannot be scheduled for execution", e);
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Task is null");
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            if (System.getSecurityManager() != null) {
                System.getSecurityManager().checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
            }
            executor.shutdown();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("A security manager exists and shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify", e);
        }
        return future;
    }
}
```

This updated method includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the task cannot be scheduled for execution, a `RejectedExecutionException` is thrown with a message indicating the reason for the rejection.
- If the task is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating that the task is null.
- If a security manager exists and shutting down the `ExecutorService` may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify, a `SecurityException` is thrown with a message indicating that a security manager exists and the reason for the denial of access.
