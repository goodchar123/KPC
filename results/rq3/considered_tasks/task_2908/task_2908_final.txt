Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error handling:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class DocumentationTask {
    public static Future<String> createDocumentationTask(String component, String[] arguments) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<String> future = null;
        try {
            future = executor.submit(() -> {
                // Perform documentation task here using component and arguments
                // Return the result as a String
                return "Documentation task completed for " + component;
            });
        } catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task cannot be scheduled for execution", e);
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Task is null");
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            if (System.getSecurityManager() != null) {
                System.getSecurityManager().checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
            }
            executor.shutdown();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("A security manager exists and shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify", e);
        }
        return future;
    }
}
```

This updated method includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the task cannot be scheduled for execution, a `RejectedExecutionException` is thrown with a message indicating the reason for the rejection.
- If the task is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating that the task is null.
- If a security manager exists and shutting down the `ExecutorService` may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify, a `SecurityException` is thrown with a message indicating that a security manager exists and the reason for the denial of access.
