Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this duration with a positive length.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a duration with a positive length:

```java
public Duration getPositiveDuration(Duration duration) {
    if (duration.isNegative()) {
        return duration.negated();
    } else {
        return duration;
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Duration` object as input and checks if it is negative using the `isNegative()` method. If it is negative, it returns a negated copy of the duration using the `negated()` method. If it is not negative, it simply returns the original duration. This ensures that the returned duration always has a positive length.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.Duration.negated() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for numeric overflow when calling `Duration.negated()`:

```java
public Duration getPositiveDuration(Duration duration) {
    if (duration.isNegative()) {
        try {
            return duration.negated();
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred when negating duration");
        }
    } else {
        return duration;
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may be thrown when calling `Duration.negated()`. If an `ArithmeticException` is caught, it throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom message indicating that a numeric overflow occurred. If no exception is caught, it simply returns the original duration.

This ensures that the method handles potential numeric overflow issues when negating a duration.
