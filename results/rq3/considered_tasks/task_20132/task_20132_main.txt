Please write a java method that Reads the next value as a long and advances this va list's position.
Here's a Java method that reads the next value as a long and advances the position of the va list:

```
public static long getNextLong(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner.hasNextLong()) {
        long value = scanner.nextLong();
        scanner.nextLine(); // advance the position
        return value;
    } else {
        throw new InputMismatchException("Next value is not a long");
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Scanner` object as input and checks if the next value in the scanner is a long using the `hasNextLong()` method. If it is, it reads the long value using the `nextLong()` method and advances the position of the scanner using the `nextLine()` method. If the next value is not a long, it throws an `InputMismatchException`. The method returns the long value that was read.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if input is exhausted for java.util.Scanner.nextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.nextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if no line was found for java.util.Scanner.nextLine() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.nextLine() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

        throw new NullPointerException("Scanner is null");
    }

        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("Input is exhausted");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNextLong()) {
        throw new InputMismatchException("Next value is not a long");
    }
    long value = scanner.nextLong();
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {

        throw new NoSuchElementException("No line was found");
    }
    return value;
}
```

This method now includes the requested checks. It first checks if the scanner is null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. It then checks if the scanner is closed using the `ioException()` method and throws an `IllegalStateException` if it is. It also checks if the input is exhausted using the `hasNext()` method and throws a `NoSuchElementException` if it is. If the next value is not a long, it throws an `InputMismatchException`.

After reading the long value, it checks again if the scanner is closed using the `ioException()` method and throws an `IllegalStateException` if it is. It then advances the position of the scanner using the `nextLine()` method and checks again if the scanner is closed using the `ioException()` method and throws an `IllegalStateException` if it is. Finally, it checks if no line was found using the `hasNextLine()` method and throws a `NoSuchElementException` if it is. The method returns the long value that was read.

Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if input is exhausted for java.util.Scanner.nextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNext() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```
public static long getNextLong(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Scanner is null");
    }
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
