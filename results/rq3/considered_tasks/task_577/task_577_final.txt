Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a security manager and the necessary permission before resetting the peak thread count:

```
public void resetPeakThreadCount() throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new ManagementPermission("control"));
    }
    ThreadMXBean threadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
    threadBean.resetPeakThreadCount();
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager is present using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a security manager is present, it then checks if the caller has the necessary `ManagementPermission("control")` using the `SecurityManager.checkPermission()` method. If the caller does not have the necessary permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the security checks pass, the method proceeds to reset the peak thread count using the `ThreadMXBean.resetPeakThreadCount()` method.
