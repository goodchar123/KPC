Please write a java method that Resets the peak thread count to the current number of live threads.
Here's a Java method that resets the peak thread count to the current number of live threads:

```
public void resetPeakThreadCount() {
    ThreadMXBean threadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
    threadBean.resetPeakThreadCount();
}
```

This method uses the `ThreadMXBean` class from the `java.lang.management` package to access information about the current thread count and peak thread count. The `resetPeakThreadCount()` method of the `ThreadMXBean` class resets the peak thread count to the current number of live threads.

Please check if a security manager         exists and the caller does not have         ManagementPermission("control"). for java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean.resetPeakThreadCount() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a security manager and the necessary permission before resetting the peak thread count:

```
public void resetPeakThreadCount() throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new ManagementPermission("control"));
    }
    ThreadMXBean threadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
    threadBean.resetPeakThreadCount();
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager is present using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a security manager is present, it then checks if the caller has the necessary `ManagementPermission("control")` using the `SecurityManager.checkPermission()` method. If the caller does not have the necessary permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the security checks pass, the method proceeds to reset the peak thread count using the `ThreadMXBean.resetPeakThreadCount()` method.
