Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this LocalTime with the hour-of-day altered.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given LocalTime object with the hour-of-day altered:

```java
public static LocalTime withHour(LocalTime time, int hour) {
    return time.withHour(hour);
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the first parameter is the LocalTime object that you want to modify, and the second parameter is the new hour-of-day value that you want to set. The method returns a new LocalTime object with the hour-of-day value set to the specified value.

You can call this method like this:

```java
LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
LocalTime newTime = withHour(time, 10);
```

This will create a new LocalTime object with the hour-of-day set to 10. The original LocalTime object `time` will not be modified.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the hour value is invalid for java.time.LocalTime.withHour(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the hour value is valid and throws a `DateTimeException` if it's not:

```java
public static LocalTime withHour(LocalTime time, int hour) {
    if (hour < 0 || hour > 23) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid hour value: " + hour);
    }
    return time.withHour(hour);
}
```

This method first checks if the hour value is between 0 and 23 (inclusive). If it's not, it throws a `DateTimeException` with a message indicating the invalid hour value. If the hour value is valid, it calls the `withHour` method on the given `LocalTime` object with the new hour value and returns the resulting `LocalTime` object.

You can call this updated method in the same way as before:

```java
LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
LocalTime newTime = withHour(time, 10);
```

If you call the method with an invalid hour value, like this:

```java
LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
LocalTime newTime = withHour(time, 25);
```

It will throw a `DateTimeException` with the message "Invalid hour value: 25".
