Please write a java method that Set the handler invoked when this thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception.
Sure, here's an example Java method that sets the uncaught exception handler for a thread:

```java
public static void setUncaughtExceptionHandler(Thread thread, Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler handler) {
    thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler(handler);
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the `Thread` object for which you want to set the uncaught exception handler, and the `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler` object that will handle any uncaught exceptions thrown by the thread.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Thread myThread = new Thread(myRunnable);
setUncaughtExceptionHandler(myThread, myExceptionHandler);
```

Where `myRunnable` is the `Runnable` object that the thread will execute, and `myExceptionHandler` is the `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler` object that will handle any uncaught exceptions thrown by the thread.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread is not allowed to          modify this thread. for java.lang.Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler(java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `setUncaughtExceptionHandler` method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the target thread:

```java
public static void setUncaughtExceptionHandler(Thread thread, Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler handler) {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
        if (thread.getThreadGroup() != Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup()) {
            throw new SecurityException("Cannot modify thread in different thread group");
        }
    }
    thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler(handler);
}
```

This method first checks if there is a `SecurityManager` installed, and if so, checks if the current thread has the `modifyThread` permission. If the target thread is in a different thread group than the current thread, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Thread myThread = new Thread(myRunnable);
setUncaughtExceptionHandler(myThread, myExceptionHandler);
```

Where `myRunnable` is the `Runnable` object that the thread will execute, and `myExceptionHandler` is the `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler` object that will handle any uncaught exceptions thrown by the thread. If the current thread is not allowed to modify the target thread, a `SecurityException` will be thrown.
------------------------------------------------------

    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
        if (thread.getThreadGroup() != Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup()) {
            throw new SecurityException("Cannot modify thread in different thread group");
        }
    }

}
```

```

------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread is not allowed to          modify this thread. for java.lang.Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler(java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
