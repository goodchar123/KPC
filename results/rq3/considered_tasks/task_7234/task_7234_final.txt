Sure, here's an updated version of the `setUncaughtExceptionHandler` method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the target thread:

```java
public static void setUncaughtExceptionHandler(Thread thread, Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler handler) {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
        if (thread.getThreadGroup() != Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup()) {
            throw new SecurityException("Cannot modify thread in different thread group");
        }
    }
    thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler(handler);
}
```

This method first checks if there is a `SecurityManager` installed, and if so, checks if the current thread has the `modifyThread` permission. If the target thread is in a different thread group than the current thread, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Thread myThread = new Thread(myRunnable);
setUncaughtExceptionHandler(myThread, myExceptionHandler);
```

Where `myRunnable` is the `Runnable` object that the thread will execute
