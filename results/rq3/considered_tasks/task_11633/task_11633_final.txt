Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks for buffer overflow and read-only buffer conditions:

```java
public void putChar(char value) throws BufferOverflowException, ReadOnlyBufferException {
    if (buffer.isReadOnly()) {
        throw new ReadOnlyBufferException();
    }
    if (buffer.remaining() < 2) {
        throw new BufferOverflowException();
    }
    buffer.putChar(value);
}
```

This method first checks if the buffer is read-only using the isReadOnly() method. If the buffer is read-only, the method throws a ReadOnlyBufferException.

Next, the method checks if there are fewer than two bytes remaining in the buffer using the remaining() method. If there are fewer than two bytes remaining, the method throws a BufferOverflowException.

If neither of these conditions are met, the method writes the char value to the buffer using the putChar() method.
