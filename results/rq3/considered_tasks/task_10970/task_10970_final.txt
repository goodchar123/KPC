Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested check:

```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel;
import java.nio.channels.NonWritableChannelException;

public void writeToChannel(WritableByteChannel channel, ByteBuffer buffer) throws Exception {
    if (!(channel instanceof WritableByteChannel)) {
        throw new NonWritableChannelException();
    }
    while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
        channel.write(buffer);
    }
}
```

This updated method checks if the channel is writable using the `instanceof` operator. If the channel is not writable, it throws a `NonWritableChannelException`.

During the write operation, the method loops through the buffer and writes the bytes to the channel using the `write()` method of the channel. The loop continues until all bytes in the buffer have been written to the channel.

Note that this method still throws any other exceptions that may occur during the write operation, such as `IOException`. You can handle these exceptions in your code as needed.
