Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws an `IOException` if any of them occur:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketUtils {
    public static InputStream getInputStream(Socket socket) throws IOException {
        if (socket.isClosed()) {
            throw new IOException("Socket is closed");
        }
        if (!socket.isConnected()) {
            throw new IOException("Socket is not connected");
        }
        if (socket.isInputShutdown()) {
            throw new IOException("Socket input has been shutdown");
        }
        try {
            return socket.getInputStream();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            socket.close();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the socket is closed, not connected, or if the input has been shutdown. If any of these conditions are true, it throws an `IOException` with an appropriate message.

If none of these conditions are true, it attempts to get the input stream from the socket. If an `IOException` occurs while getting the input stream, it closes the socket and re-throws the exception.
