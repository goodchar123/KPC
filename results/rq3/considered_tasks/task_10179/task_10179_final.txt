Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for I/O errors and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
public static void readAndWrite(Reader reader, Writer writer) throws IOException {
    int c;
    while (true) {
        try {
            c = reader.read();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading from input stream", e);
        }
        if (c == -1) {
            break;
        }
        try {
            writer.write(c);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing to output stream", e);
        }
    }
    try {
        writer.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error flushing output stream", e);
    }
}
```

In this updated method, we've added a try-catch block around the `read()` method to catch any `IOException` that may occur. If an `IOException` is caught, we throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message and the original exception as the cause.

We've also modified the loop condition to use `while (true)` and added a `break` statement when the end of the input stream is reached. This ensures that we properly handle any I/O errors that occur during the reading process and exit the loop when necessary.

Finally, we've added a try-catch block around the `flush()` method to catch any `IOException` that may occur while flushing the output stream. If an `IOException` is caught, we throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message and the original exception as the cause.

By doing this, we ensure that any I/O errors that occur during the reading or writing process are properly handled and propagated up the call stack.
