
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for a database access error or a closed result set before calling `next()` on the `ResultSet`. If either of these conditions is true, it throws a `SQLException`:

```java
public boolean supportsConvert() throws SQLException {
    boolean supportsConvert = false;
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = connection.getMetaData();
    ResultSet rs = metaData.getFunctions(null, null, "CONVERT");
    try {
        if (rs != null && !rs.isClosed()) {
            while (rs.next()) {
                String functionName = rs.getString("FUNCTION_NAME");
                if (functionName.equalsIgnoreCase("CONVERT")) {
                    supportsConvert = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        } else {
            throw new SQLException("ResultSet is closed or null");
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error accessing database or ResultSet", e);
    }
    return supportsConvert;
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `ResultSet` is not null and not closed before calling `next()` on it. If either of these conditions is true, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message. If `next()` is called successfully, it proceeds with the rest of the method as before. 

Additionally, if a `SQLException` is caught during the execution of the method, it re-throws the exception with a more informative error message.
