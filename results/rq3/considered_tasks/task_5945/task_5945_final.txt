Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for errors in the underlying protocol and throws a SocketException if necessary:

```java
public int getReceiveBufferSize(ServerSocket serverSocket) throws IOException, SocketException {
    int bufferSize = serverSocket.getReceiveBufferSize();
    if (bufferSize < 0) {
        throw new SocketException("Error in underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.");
    }
    return bufferSize;
}
```

This method first retrieves the receive buffer size using the `getReceiveBufferSize()` method of the ServerSocket object. It then checks if the buffer size is less than zero, which indicates an error in the underlying protocol. If an error is detected, a SocketException is thrown with an appropriate error message. Otherwise, the buffer size is returned.
