Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block surrounding the `while` loop that calls `inputStream.read(buffer)`.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught specifically for the `inputStream.read(buffer)` method call in the code snippet. However, the method does check if the `byte[]` buffer is `null` before reading from the input stream, which could potentially prevent a `NullPointerException` from occurring.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is not handled or caught specifically for the `outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead)` method call in the code snippet. However, any `IOException` that occurs during the write operation will be caught by the `try-catch` block surrounding the `while` loop that calls `inputStream.read(buffer)`.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block that calls `inputStream.close()` in the `finally` block of the method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block that calls `outputStream.close()` in the `finally` block of the method.

------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block surrounding the `while` loop that reads from the input stream. If an `IOException` occurs while reading from the input stream, it is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught specifically for the `read()` method of the `InputStream`. The code includes a check for `null` on the `byte[]` buffer before reading from the input stream, but if a `NullPointerException` occurs during the `read()` method, it will not be caught or handled by the `try-catch` block in the code.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block surrounding the `while` loop that writes to the output stream. If an `IOException` occurs while writing to the output stream, it is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block that closes the input stream. If an `IOException` occurs while closing the input stream, it is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block that closes the output stream. If an `IOException` occurs while closing the output stream, it is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.

Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is handled or caught for `java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int)` in the code snippet. It is caught in the `try-catch` block that surrounds the `while` loop where the `write()` method is called.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is not handled or caught for `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[])` in the code snippet. It is only declared in the method signature with the `throws` keyword, which means that any `IOException` that occurs during the execution of the method will be thrown to the calling method to handle.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught for `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[])` in the code snippet. It is only checked for in an `if` statement before the `write()` method is called. If the buffer is `null`, a `NullPointerException` is thrown, but it is not caught or handled in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
