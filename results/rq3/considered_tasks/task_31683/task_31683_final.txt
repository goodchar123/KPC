
Thank you for bringing this to my attention again. Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error checking you mentioned:

```java
import java.io.*;

public void writeAudioFileToOutputStream(File audioFile, String fileType, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(audioFile);
    byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
    int bytesRead;
    try {
        while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            if (buffer == null) {
                throw new NullPointerException("Byte array buffer is null");
            }
            try {
                outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error writing to output stream: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        if (e instanceof EOFException) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading from input stream: end of file reached");
        } else {
            throw new IOException("Error reading from input stream: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    } finally {
        try {
            inputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error closing input stream: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        try {
            outputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error closing output stream: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method includes a check for `null` on the `byte[]` buffer before reading from the input stream. If the buffer is `null`, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.

Additionally, the method includes a `try-catch` block around the `outputStream.write()` method to check for an `IOException` that might occur if the output stream is closed. If an `IOException` occurs, it is re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.

Finally, the method includes `try-catch` blocks around the `close()` methods for both the input and output streams. If an `IOException` occurs while closing either stream, it is re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.
