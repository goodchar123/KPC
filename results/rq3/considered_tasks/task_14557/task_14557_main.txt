Please write a java method that Finds and returns the next complete token from this scanner.
Here's a Java method that finds and returns the next complete token from a scanner:

```java
public String getNextToken(Scanner scanner) {
    String token = "";
    while (scanner.hasNext()) {
        token = scanner.next();
        if (!token.isEmpty()) {
            break;
        }
    }
    return token;
}
```

This method takes a `Scanner` object as input and returns the next complete token as a `String`. It uses a `while` loop to iterate through the scanner's input, calling the `next()` method to retrieve the next token. If the token is not empty, the loop breaks and the token is returned. If the scanner has no more input, an empty string is returned.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNext() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if no more tokens are available for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public String getNextToken(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Scanner cannot be null");
    }
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No more tokens available");
    }
    String token = scanner.next();
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    return token;
}
```

This method now checks for three conditions before returning the next token:

1. If the scanner is null, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.
2. If the scanner is closed, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.
3. If there are no more tokens available, it throws a `NoSuchElementException`.

Additionally, it checks for a closed scanner after retrieving the token to ensure that the scanner is still open. If the scanner is closed, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.
