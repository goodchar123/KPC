Is the IOException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.AsynchronousSocketChannel.open() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
The `IOException` is not caught or handled explicitly for `AsynchronousSocketChannel.open()` in the code snippet. It is declared as a checked exception in the method signature and can be thrown if an I/O error occurs while opening the channel. The exception is propagated up the call stack to the method that invokes `openSocketChannel()`, where it is caught and handled.

The exception is caught in the `try-catch` block in the `openSocketChannel()` method and the channel is closed before re-throwing the exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ConnectionPendingException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.AsynchronousSocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
The `ConnectionPendingException` is caught and handled explicitly for `AsynchronousSocketChannel.connect(SocketAddress)` in the code snippet. It is declared as a checked exception in the method signature and can be thrown if a connection operation is already in progress on this channel. The exception is caught in the `try-catch` block in the `openSocketChannel()` method and the channel is closed before re-throwing the exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SecurityException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.AsynchronousSocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
The `SecurityException` is caught and handled explicitly for `AsynchronousSocketChannel.connect(SocketAddress)` in the code snippet. It is declared as a checked exception in the method signature and can be thrown if a security manager has been installed and it does not permit access to the given remote endpoint. The exception is caught in the `try-catch` block in the `openSocketChannel()` method and the channel is closed before re-throwing the exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the CancellationException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
The `CancellationException` is not caught or handled explicitly for `Future.get()` in the code snippet. It is declared as a checked exception in the method signature and can be thrown if the computation was cancelled. The exception is propagated up the call stack to the method that invokes `handleFutureException()`, where it is caught and re-thrown or handled accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ExecutionException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
The `ExecutionException` is caught and handled explicitly for `Future.get()` in the code snippet. It is declared as a checked exception in the method signature and can be thrown if an exception occurred during the computation of the `Future`. The exception is caught in the `try-catch` block in the `handleFutureException()` method and the cause of the exception is checked. If the cause is an `IOException`, it is re-thrown as an `IOException`. Otherwise, the exception is re-thrown as an `ExecutionException`.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the InterruptedException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
The `InterruptedException` is not caught or handled explicitly for `Future.get()` in the code snippet. It is declared as a checked exception in the method signature and can be thrown if the current thread is interrupted while waiting for the computation to complete. The exception is propagated up the call stack to the method that invokes `handleFutureException()`, where it is caught and re-thrown or handled accordingly.
