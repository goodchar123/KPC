Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the requested error handling:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.net.SocketAddress;
import java.nio.channels.AlreadyConnectedException;
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousSocketChannel;
import java.nio.channels.ConnectionPendingException;
import java.nio.channels.UnsupportedAddressTypeException;
import java.nio.channels.UnresolvedAddressException;
import java.util.concurrent.CancellationException;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class AsyncSocketChannelExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        AsynchronousSocketChannel channel = openSocketChannel("localhost", 8080);
        // use the channel for reading and writing data asynchronously
        channel.close();
    }
    
    public static AsynchronousSocketChannel openSocketChannel(String host, int port) throws IOException, UnresolvedAddressException, UnsupportedAddressTypeException, AlreadyConnectedException, ConnectionPendingException, SecurityException {
        AsynchronousSocketChannel channel = null;
        try {
            channel = AsynchronousSocketChannel.open();
            SocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress(host, port);
            Future<Void> future = channel.connect(address);
            future.get(); // wait for the connection to complete
        } catch (IOException | UnresolvedAddressException | UnsupportedAddressTypeException | AlreadyConnectedException | ConnectionPendingException | SecurityException e) {
            if (channel != null) {
                try {
                    channel.close();
                } catch (IOException ex) {
                    // ignore
                }
            }
            throw e;
        }
        return channel;
    }
    
    public static void handleFutureException(Future<?> future) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException, CancellationException {
        try {
            future.get();
        } catch (ExecutionException e) {
            Throwable cause = e.getCause();
            if (cause instanceof IOException) {
                throw (IOException) cause;
            } else {
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated code snippet includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If an I/O error occurs for `AsynchronousSocketChannel.open()`, an `IOException` is thrown.
- If the given remote address is not fully resolved for `AsynchronousSocketChannel.connect(SocketAddress)`, an `UnresolvedAddressException` is thrown.
- If the type of the given remote address is not supported for `AsynchronousSocketChannel.connect(SocketAddress)`, an `UnsupportedAddressTypeException` is thrown.
- If this channel is already connected for `AsynchronousSocketChannel.connect(SocketAddress)`, an `AlreadyConnectedException` is thrown.
- If a connection operation is already in progress on this channel for `AsynchronousSocketChannel.connect(SocketAddress)`, a `ConnectionPendingException` is thrown.
- If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit access to the given remote endpoint for `AsynchronousSocketChannel.connect(SocketAddress)`, a `SecurityException` is thrown.
- If the computation was cancelled for `Future.get()`, a `CancellationException` is thrown.

Additionally, the `openSocketChannel` method now catches any exceptions that may occur during the connection process and closes the channel before re-throwing the exception. The `handleFutureException` method can be used to handle exceptions that may occur when waiting for a `Future` to complete.
