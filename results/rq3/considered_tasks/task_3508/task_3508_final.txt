Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error checking:

```java
public String getProperty(String key) {
    Properties props = new Properties();
    try {
        FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("config.properties");
        props.load(in);
        in.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    if (props.containsKey(key)) {
        return props.getProperty(key);
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

This method now includes three additional catch blocks to check for the requested errors. If a malformed Unicode escape sequence is found in the input stream, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. If the input stream is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown. 

After catching any of these errors, the method simply prints the stack trace. If the key is found in the properties, the method returns the associated value. Otherwise, it returns `null`. 

Again, you can modify this method to suit your specific needs, such as changing the name of the properties file or handling exceptions differently.
