Please write a java method that Look up the value of a property.
Here's an example Java method that looks up the value of a property:

```java
public String getProperty(String key) {
    Properties props = new Properties();
    try {
        FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("config.properties");
        props.load(in);
        in.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return props.getProperty(key);
}
```

This method takes a `key` parameter, which is the name of the property to look up. It then loads the properties from a file called `config.properties`, and returns the value associated with the given key. If the key is not found, it returns `null`. 

You can modify this method to suit your specific needs, such as changing the name of the properties file or handling exceptions differently.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the input stream contains a             malformed Unicode escape sequence. for java.util.Properties.load(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if inStream is null. for java.util.Properties.load(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error checking:

```java
public String getProperty(String key) {
    Properties props = new Properties();
    try {
        FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("config.properties");
        props.load(in);
        in.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    if (props.containsKey(key)) {
        return props.getProperty(key);
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

This method now includes three additional catch blocks to check for the requested errors. If a malformed Unicode escape sequence is found in the input stream, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. If the input stream is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown. 

After catching any of these errors, the method simply prints the stack trace. If the key is found in the properties, the method returns the associated value. Otherwise, it returns `null`. 

Again, you can modify this method to suit your specific needs, such as changing the name of the properties file or handling exceptions differently.
