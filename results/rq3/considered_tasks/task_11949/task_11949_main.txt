Please write a java method that Closes the ZIP output stream as well as the stream being filtered.
Here's a Java method that closes the ZIP output stream and the filtered stream:

```java
public void closeStreams(ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream, FilterOutputStream filterOutputStream) {
    try {
        if (filterOutputStream != null) {
            filterOutputStream.close();
        }
        if (zipOutputStream != null) {
            zipOutputStream.close();
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

You can call this method by passing the ZIP output stream and the filtered stream as parameters. The method checks if the streams are not null and then closes them using the `close()` method. If an exception occurs during the closing of the streams, it will be printed to the console.

Please check if a ZIP file error has occurred for java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ZipException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for ZIP file errors and throws a `ZipException` if one occurs:

```java
public void closeStreams(ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream, FilterOutputStream filterOutputStream) throws ZipException {
    try {
        if (filterOutputStream != null) {
            filterOutputStream.close();
        }
        if (zipOutputStream != null) {
            zipOutputStream.close();
            if (zipOutputStream.getFinish() && zipOutputStream.getDef().finished()) {
                throw new ZipException("ZIP file error occurred");
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This updated method checks if the ZIP output stream has finished writing and if the underlying `Deflater` has finished compressing. If both conditions are true, it throws a `ZipException` with the message "ZIP file error occurred". If an exception occurs during the closing of the streams, it will be printed to the console.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error has occurred for java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for I/O errors and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public void closeStreams(ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream, FilterOutputStream filterOutputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        if (filterOutputStream != null) {
            filterOutputStream.close();
        }
        if (zipOutputStream != null) {
            zipOutputStream.close();
            if (zipOutputStream.getFinish() && zipOutputStream.getDef().finished()) {
                throw new ZipException("ZIP file error occurred");
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method checks if an I/O error occurred during the closing of the streams. If an `IOException` occurs, it is re-thrown. If the ZIP output stream has finished writing and the underlying `Deflater` has finished compressing, it throws a `ZipException` with the message "ZIP file error occurred".
