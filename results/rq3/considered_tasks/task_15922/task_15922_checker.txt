------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught in the try-catch block that surrounds the `while` loop where `inputStream.read(buffer)` is called.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `NullPointerException` is caught in the try-catch block that surrounds the `while` loop where `inputStream.read(buffer)` is called.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is not handled or caught specifically for the `OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int)` method in the code snippet. However, any `IOException` that occurs during the execution of the `while` loop will be caught by the catch block that catches `IOException` in general.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught in the try-catch block that surrounds the `finally` block where `inputStream.close()` is called.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught in the try-catch block that surrounds the `finally` block where `outputStream.close()` is called.

------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the try-catch block that surrounds the `while` loop in the `copyFileToOutputStream` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `NullPointerException` is caught and handled in the try-catch block that surrounds the `while` loop in the `copyFileToOutputStream` method.
------------------------------------------------------
