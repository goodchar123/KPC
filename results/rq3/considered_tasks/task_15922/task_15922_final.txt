Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Here's an updated version of the method that includes the error checking you mentioned:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileCopy {
    public static void copyFileToOutputStream(File file, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
        InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(file);
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int bytesRead;
        try {
            while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                try {
                    outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new IOException("Error writing to output stream: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading from input stream: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Byte array is null: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                if (inputStream != null) {
                    inputStream.close();
                }
                if (outputStream != null) {
                    outputStream.close();
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error closing streams: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated version includes a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur when writing to the output stream. It also includes a finally block to ensure that both streams are closed, even if an exception is thrown.
