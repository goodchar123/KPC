Please write a java method that Closes the TLS connection gracefully and reverts back to the underlying connection.
Here's an example Java method that closes the TLS connection gracefully and reverts back to the underlying connection:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;

public void closeTLSSocket(SSLSocket sslSocket) {
    try {
        // Shutdown the SSL socket gracefully
        sslSocket.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle any exceptions that occur during the shutdown process
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    // Revert back to the underlying connection
    try {
        sslSocket.startHandshake();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle any exceptions that occur during the handshake process
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This method takes an `SSLSocket` object as a parameter and first closes the TLS connection gracefully using the `close()` method. If any exceptions occur during the shutdown process, they are caught and printed to the console.

After the TLS connection is closed, the method then reverts back to the underlying connection by calling the `startHandshake()` method on the `SSLSocket` object. Again, any exceptions that occur during this process are caught and printed to the console.

Please check on a network level error for javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket.startHandshake() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for network level errors during the `startHandshake()` method and throws an `IOException` if any occur:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import java.io.IOException;

public void closeTLSSocket(SSLSocket sslSocket) throws IOException {
    try {
        // Shutdown the SSL socket gracefully
        sslSocket.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle any exceptions that occur during the shutdown process
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    // Revert back to the underlying connection
    try {
        sslSocket.startHandshake();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Check for network level errors and throw an IOException if any occur
        if (e.getMessage().contains("Network is unreachable") || e.getMessage().contains("Connection refused")) {
            throw new IOException("Network level error occurred during SSL handshake", e);
        } else {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle any other exceptions that occur during the handshake process
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This updated method now throws an `IOException` if a network level error occurs during the `startHandshake()` method. It checks for two specific error messages ("Network is unreachable" and "Connection refused") and throws the `IOException` with a custom message if either of these messages are found in the exception's message.

If any other exceptions occur during the handshake process, they are caught and printed to the console as before.
