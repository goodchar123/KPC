Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the result is inexact but the rounding mode is UNNECESSARY or mc.precision == 0 and the quotient has a non-terminating decimal expansion, including dividing by zero for java.math.BigDecimal.divide(java.math.BigDecimal,java.math.MathContext), otherwise throws an ArithmeticException:

```
public BigDecimal divideWithRounding(BigDecimal divisor, MathContext context) {
    BigDecimal result = this.divide(divisor, context);
    if (context.getRoundingMode() == RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY && !result.equals(this.divide(divisor, new MathContext(0, RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY)))) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Rounding necessary");
    }
    return result;
}
```

This updated method first calls the `divide()` method on `this` with `divisor` and `context` as arguments, and stores the result in a `BigDecimal` variable named `result`.

It then checks if the rounding mode specified in the `context` parameter is `RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY`, and if the result is not equal to the exact quotient obtained by dividing `this` by `divisor` with the `RoundingMode.UNNECESSARY` rounding mode and a precision of 0. If this condition is true, it means that the result is inexact but the rounding mode is `UNNECESSARY` or `mc.precision == 0` and the quotient has a non-terminating decimal expansion, including dividing by zero, so an `ArithmeticException` is thrown.

If the condition is false, the method returns the `result` variable as the result of the method call.
