Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this time with the specified amount added.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given time with the specified amount added:

```java
public static LocalTime addTime(LocalTime time, Duration duration) {
    return time.plus(duration);
}
```

This method takes in a `LocalTime` object and a `Duration` object as parameters. It then returns a new `LocalTime` object that is the original time with the specified duration added to it. The original time object is not modified.

You can call this method like this:

```java
LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(10, 30);
Duration duration = Duration.ofMinutes(15);
LocalTime newTime = addTime(time, duration);
System.out.println(newTime); // Output: 10:45
```
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the value of any field is out of range for java.time.LocalTime.of(int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Please check if the input minutes exceeds the capacity of Duration for java.time.Duration.ofMinutes(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Please check if the addition cannot be made for java.time.LocalTime.plus(java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.LocalTime.plus(java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error checking:

```java
public static LocalTime addTime(LocalTime time, Duration duration) {
    try {
        return time.plus(duration);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Value of field is out of range for LocalTime", e);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        if (duration.getSeconds() > 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Input minutes exceeds the capacity of Duration");
        } else {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while adding duration to LocalTime");
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method checks for the following errors:

- If the value of any field is out of range for `LocalTime`, a `DateTimeException` is thrown with a custom error message.
- If the input minutes exceeds the capacity of `Duration`, an `ArithmeticException` is thrown with a custom error message.
- If the addition cannot be made for `LocalTime.plus(TemporalAmount)`, a `DateTimeException` is thrown with a custom error message.
- If numeric overflow occurs for `LocalTime.plus(TemporalAmount)`, an `ArithmeticException` is thrown with a custom error message.

You can call this method like this:

```java
LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(10, 30);
Duration duration = Duration.ofMinutes(Long.MAX_VALUE);
try {
    LocalTime newTime = addTime(time, duration);
    System.out.println(newTime);
} catch (DateTimeException | ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}
```

In this example, the `Duration` object has a value that exceeds the capacity of `Duration`, so an `ArithmeticException` is thrown with the custom error message "Input minutes exceeds the capacity of Duration".
