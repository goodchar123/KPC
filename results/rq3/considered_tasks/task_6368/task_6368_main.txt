Please write a java method that Converts this duration to the total length in nanoseconds expressed as a long.
Sure, here's a Java method that converts a duration to the total length in nanoseconds expressed as a long:

```java
public static long durationToNanos(Duration duration) {
    return duration.toNanos();
}
```

This method takes a `Duration` object as input and returns the total length of the duration in nanoseconds as a `long`. The `toNanos()` method of the `Duration` class is used to convert the duration to nanoseconds.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.Duration.toNanos() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for numeric overflow when converting a `Duration` to nanoseconds using the `toNanos()` method:

```java
public static long durationToNanos(Duration duration) {
    long nanos = duration.toNanos();
    if (duration.compareTo(Duration.ofNanos(nanos)) != 0) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred when converting Duration to nanoseconds");
    }
    return nanos;
}
```

This method first calls the `toNanos()` method of the `Duration` class to convert the duration to nanoseconds and stores the result in a `long` variable called `nanos`. It then compares the original duration with a new `Duration` object created from the `nanos` value using the `ofNanos()` method. If the two durations are not equal, it means that a numeric overflow occurred during the conversion, so the method throws an `ArithmeticException` with an appropriate error message. Otherwise, it returns the `nanos` value.
