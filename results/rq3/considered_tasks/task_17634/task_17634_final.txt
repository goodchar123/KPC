Here is an updated version of the code snippet that includes the requested error handling:

```
try {
    Object obj = constructor.newInstance(args);
    return obj;
} catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Constructor is inaccessible", e);
} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Invalid arguments for constructor", e);
} catch (InstantiationException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Cannot instantiate abstract class", e);
} catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Constructor threw an exception", e);
} catch (ExceptionInInitializerError e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Initialization failed", e);
}
```

This code uses a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors that may occur when invoking the constructor using reflection.

If the constructor is inaccessible due to access control, an `IllegalAccessException` is thrown and a `RuntimeException` is thrown with a message indicating that the constructor is inaccessible.

If the number of actual and formal parameters differ, or if there is a problem with unwrapping primitive arguments, or if a parameter value cannot be converted to the corresponding formal parameter type, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown and a `RuntimeException` is thrown with a message indicating that the arguments for the constructor are invalid.

If the class that declares the underlying constructor is an abstract class, an `InstantiationException` is thrown and a `RuntimeException` is thrown with a message indicating that the class cannot be instantiated.

If the underlying constructor throws an exception, an `InvocationTargetException` is thrown and a `RuntimeException` is thrown with a message indicating that the constructor threw an exception.

If the initialization provoked by the constructor fails, an `ExceptionInInitializerError` is thrown and a `RuntimeException` is thrown with a message indicating that the initialization failed.
