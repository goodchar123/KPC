Sure, here's an updated version of the `sleep` method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the thread for `Thread.interrupt()`. If not, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class SleepExample {
    public static void sleep(long duration, TimeUnit unit) {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
        }
        try {
            unit.sleep(duration);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed. If so, it checks if the current thread has the `modifyThread` permission. If not, it throws a `SecurityException`. If the permission is granted, it performs the `Thread.sleep` as before.

Note that this check is only necessary if a `SecurityManager` is installed. If not, the method will behave as before without any security checks.
