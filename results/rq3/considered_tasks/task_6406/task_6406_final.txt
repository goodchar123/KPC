Sure, here's the modified code snippet that checks for the various exceptions you mentioned when adding an element to a `List`:

```java
public void addElementToList(List<String> list, String element) {
    try {
        // Check if the add operation is supported by this list
        if (!list.add(element)) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Add operation is not supported by this list");
        }
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        // Check if the class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this list
        throw new ClassCastException("Class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this list");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        // Check if the specified element is null and this list does not permit null elements
        throw new NullPointerException("Specified element is null and this list does not permit null elements");
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        // Check if some property of this element prevents it from being added to this list
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some property of this element prevents it from being added to this list");
    }
}
```

This method takes a `List` and an element to add to the list. It checks for the various exceptions you mentioned and throws the appropriate exception if any of the checks fail.

Note that this is just an example and may need to be modified to fit your specific use case.
