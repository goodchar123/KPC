Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the requested checks:

```java
public void receiveDatagram(DatagramChannel channel) throws IOException {
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    int bytesRead = 0;
    try {
        while (bytesRead == 0) {
            if (buffer.isReadOnly()) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Buffer is read-only");
            }
            if (!channel.isOpen()) {
                throw new ClosedChannelException();
            }
            bytesRead = channel.read(buffer);
        }
    } catch (AsynchronousCloseException e) {
        throw new AsynchronousCloseException();
    } catch (ClosedByInterruptException e) {
        throw new ClosedByInterruptException();
    } catch (ClosedChannelException e) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException();
    }
    buffer.flip();
    String message = new String(buffer.array(), 0, buffer.limit());
    System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
}
```

This updated method includes checks for the buffer being read-only, the channel being closed, another thread closing the channel while the read operation is in progress, another thread interrupting the current thread while the read operation is in progress and a security manager denying the operation. If any of these checks fail, the method throws the appropriate exception.
