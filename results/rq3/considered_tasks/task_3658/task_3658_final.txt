Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the error handling you requested:

```java
import javax.xml.stream.XMLEventWriter;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory;
import javax.xml.transform.Result;

public class XmlWriter {
    public static XMLEventWriter createEventWriter(Result result) throws Exception {
        XMLOutputFactory factory = null;
        try {
            factory = XMLOutputFactory.newInstance();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new FactoryConfigurationError("Unable to load XMLOutputFactory", e);
        }
        XMLEventWriter writer = null;
        try {
            writer = factory.createXMLEventWriter(result);
        } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("createXMLEventWriter not supported by this XMLOutputFactory", e);
        } catch (XMLStreamException e) {
            throw new XMLStreamException("Error creating XMLEventWriter", e);
        }
        return writer;
    }
}
```

This updated method includes error handling for the three scenarios you mentioned:

1. If an instance of `XMLOutputFactory` cannot be loaded, a `FactoryConfigurationError` is thrown with the original exception as the cause.
2. If `createXMLEventWriter` is not supported by the `XMLOutputFactory`, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown with the original exception as the cause.
3. If an error occurs while creating the `XMLEventWriter`, an `XMLStreamException` is thrown with the original exception as the cause.

This should help ensure that any errors that occur during the creation of the `XMLEventWriter` are properly handled and reported.
