
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed Statement/ResultSet objects:

```java
public int getResultSetConcurrency(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    ResultSet rs = stmt.getResultSet();
    if (rs != null) {
        if (rs.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("ResultSet is closed");
        } else {
            return rs.getConcurrency();
        }
    } else {
        throw new SQLException("No ResultSet available");
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the ResultSet object returned by `stmt.getResultSet()` is null. If it is not null, it then checks if the ResultSet object is closed by calling the `isClosed()` method. If the ResultSet object is closed, it throws a SQLException with an appropriate message. If the ResultSet object is not closed, it returns the concurrency level of the ResultSet object by calling the `getConcurrency()` method.

Similarly, if a database access error occurs or the Statement object is closed, the `stmt.getResultSet()` method will throw a SQLException. If a database access error occurs or the ResultSet object is closed, the `rs.getConcurrency()` method will throw a SQLException.
