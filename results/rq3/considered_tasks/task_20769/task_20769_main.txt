Please write a java method that Retrieves the result set concurrency for ResultSet objects generated by this Statement object.
Here's the Java method to retrieve the result set concurrency for ResultSet objects generated by a Statement object:

```java
public int getResultSetConcurrency(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    ResultSet rs = stmt.getResultSet();
    if (rs != null) {
        return rs.getConcurrency();
    } else {
        throw new SQLException("No ResultSet available");
    }
}
```

This method takes a Statement object as a parameter and returns the result set concurrency for any ResultSet objects generated by that Statement. It first calls the `getResultSet()` method on the Statement object to retrieve the current ResultSet (if any), and then calls the `getConcurrency()` method on the ResultSet object to retrieve its concurrency level. If there is no ResultSet available, the method throws a SQLException.

Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.getResultSet() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.getConcurrency() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed Statement/ResultSet objects:

```java
public int getResultSetConcurrency(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    ResultSet rs = stmt.getResultSet();
    if (rs != null) {
        if (rs.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("ResultSet is closed");
        } else {
            return rs.getConcurrency();
        }
    } else {
        throw new SQLException("No ResultSet available");
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the ResultSet object returned by `stmt.getResultSet()` is null. If it is not null, it then checks if the ResultSet object is closed by calling the `isClosed()` method. If the ResultSet object is closed, it throws a SQLException with an appropriate message. If the ResultSet object is not closed, it returns the concurrency level of the ResultSet object by calling the `getConcurrency()` method.

Similarly, if a database access error occurs or the Statement object is closed, the `stmt.getResultSet()` method will throw a SQLException. If a database access error occurs or the ResultSet object is closed, the `rs.getConcurrency()` method will throw a SQLException.
