
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for both a database access error when calling `isClosed()` and a negative timeout value when calling `isValid()`, and throws a `SQLException` if either error occurs:

```java
public boolean isConnectionValid(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn == null) {
        return false;
    }
    try {
        int timeout = 0; // set timeout to 0 for immediate response
        if (timeout < 0) {
            throw new SQLException("Timeout value cannot be negative");
        }
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        return conn.isValid(timeout);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error checking if connection is valid", e);
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the `Connection` object is `null`. If it is, the method returns `false` immediately. Otherwise, it sets the timeout value to `0` for immediate response and checks if the value is negative. If the value is negative, the method throws a new `SQLException` with a message indicating that the timeout value cannot be negative. If the value is non-negative, the method tries to call `isClosed()` on the connection. If the connection is closed, the method throws a new `SQLException` with a message indicating that the connection is closed. If `isClosed()` returns `false`, the method tries to call `isValid()` on the connection. If an exception is thrown when calling `isValid()`, the method catches the exception and throws a new `SQLException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while checking if the connection is valid. If no exception is thrown, the method returns `true` if the connection is still valid.
