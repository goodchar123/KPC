
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for errors and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```java
public int getClobLength(Clob clob) throws SQLException {
    try {
        return (int) clob.length();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("The JDBC driver does not support the length() method for CLOB values.");
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error accessing the length of the CLOB value.", e);
    }
}
```

This method first tries to retrieve the length of the CLOB value using the `length()` method of the `Clob` interface. If an error occurs, it checks the error code to determine if the JDBC driver does not support the `length()` method for CLOB values. If this is the case, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`. Otherwise, it throws the original `SQLException`.

If any other type of exception occurs while accessing the length of the CLOB value, it throws a new `SQLException` with a message indicating the error. This ensures that any unexpected errors are properly handled and reported.
