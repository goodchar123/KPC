Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the stream has been marked or if the mark has been invalidated before resetting the stream:

```java
public void resetToMark(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    if (!inputStream.markSupported()) {
        throw new IOException("Mark not supported");
    }
    try {
        inputStream.reset();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Invalid mark or mark not set");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the `markSupported()` method returns `true` for the given `InputStream`. If it returns `false`, it means that the stream has not been marked and the `reset()` method cannot be called. In this case, an `IOException` is thrown with the message "Mark not supported".

If `markSupported()` returns `true`, the method attempts to call the `reset()` method on the stream. If the mark has been invalidated or not set, an `IOException` is thrown with the message "Invalid mark or mark not set".
