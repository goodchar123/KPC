Please write a java method that Reset the stream to the most recent mark.
Here's a Java method that resets the stream to the most recent mark:

```java
public void resetToMark(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    inputStream.reset();
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as a parameter and calls the `reset()` method on it. The `reset()` method resets the stream to the most recent mark. If no mark has been set, an `IOException` is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this stream has not been marked or if the          mark has been invalidated. for java.io.InputStream.reset() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the stream has been marked or if the mark has been invalidated before resetting the stream:

```java
public void resetToMark(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    if (!inputStream.markSupported()) {
        throw new IOException("Mark not supported");
    }
    try {
        inputStream.reset();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Invalid mark or mark not set");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the `markSupported()` method returns `true` for the given `InputStream`. If it returns `false`, it means that the stream has not been marked and the `reset()` method cannot be called. In this case, an `IOException` is thrown with the message "Mark not supported".

If `markSupported()` returns `true`, the method attempts to call the `reset()` method on the stream. If the mark has been invalidated or not set, an `IOException` is thrown with the message "Invalid mark or mark not set".
