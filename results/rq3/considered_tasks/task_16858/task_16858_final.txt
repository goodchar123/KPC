You are correct. It is important to check if the divisor is zero before performing the remainder operation. Here's the updated Java method that checks for divisor==0 and throws an ArithmeticException if true:

```
public BigDecimal remainder(BigDecimal divisor) {
    if (divisor.equals(BigDecimal.ZERO)) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Divisor cannot be zero");
    }
    return this.remainder(divisor);
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `divisor` is equal to zero using the `equals` method of the `BigDecimal` class. If the `divisor` is zero, an `ArithmeticException` is thrown with a message "Divisor cannot be zero". If the `divisor` is not zero, the remainder operation is performed using the `remainder` method of the `BigDecimal` class and the result is returned as a new `BigDecimal` object.
