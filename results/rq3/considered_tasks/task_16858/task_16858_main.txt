Please write a java method that Returns a BigDecimal whose value is (this % divisor).
Here's the Java method that returns a BigDecimal whose value is (this % divisor):

```
public BigDecimal remainder(BigDecimal divisor) {
    return this.remainder(divisor);
}
```

This method uses the `remainder` method of the `BigDecimal` class to calculate the remainder of `this` divided by `divisor`. The result is returned as a new `BigDecimal` object.

Please check if divisor==0 for java.math.BigDecimal.remainder(java.math.BigDecimal) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
You are correct. It is important to check if the divisor is zero before performing the remainder operation. Here's the updated Java method that checks for divisor==0 and throws an ArithmeticException if true:

```
public BigDecimal remainder(BigDecimal divisor) {
    if (divisor.equals(BigDecimal.ZERO)) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Divisor cannot be zero");
    }
    return this.remainder(divisor);
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `divisor` is equal to zero using the `equals` method of the `BigDecimal` class. If the `divisor` is zero, an `ArithmeticException` is thrown with a message "Divisor cannot be zero". If the `divisor` is not zero, the remainder operation is performed using the `remainder` method of the `BigDecimal` class and the result is returned as a new `BigDecimal` object.
