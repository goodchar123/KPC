Please write a java method that Releases the current contents of this CachedRowSet object and sends a rowSetChanged event to all registered listeners.
Here's a Java method that releases the current contents of a CachedRowSet object and sends a rowSetChanged event to all registered listeners:

```java
public void releaseCachedRowSet(CachedRowSet rowSet) throws SQLException {
    rowSet.release();
    rowSet.rowSetChanged();
}
```

This method takes a CachedRowSet object as a parameter and calls its `release()` method to release the current contents of the row set. It then calls the `rowSetChanged()` method to send a rowSetChanged event to all registered listeners. If an SQLException occurs during the release operation, it will be thrown by this method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an error occurs flushing the contents of this CachedRowSet object for javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet.release() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for errors when flushing the contents of a CachedRowSet object and throws an SQLException if necessary:

```java
public void releaseCachedRowSet(CachedRowSet rowSet) throws SQLException {
    rowSet.release();
    if (rowSet.getShowDeleted() && rowSet.rowDeleted()) {
        throw new SQLException("Error flushing contents of CachedRowSet object");
    }
    rowSet.rowSetChanged();
}
```

This method first calls the `release()` method to release the current contents of the row set. It then checks if the `getShowDeleted()` method returns true and if any rows have been deleted using the `rowDeleted()` method. If both conditions are true, it throws an SQLException with an error message indicating that there was an error flushing the contents of the CachedRowSet object. If no errors occur, it calls the `rowSetChanged()` method to send a rowSetChanged event to all registered listeners.

Please check if an error occurs flushing the contents of this CachedRowSet object for javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet.release() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a rowset implementation is unable to to determine whether rows marked for deletion are visible for javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet.getShowDeleted() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for errors when flushing the contents of a CachedRowSet object and throws an SQLException if necessary. It also checks if the rowset implementation is unable to determine whether rows marked for deletion are visible and throws an SQLException if necessary:

    rowSet.release();
    if (rowSet.getShowDeleted() && rowSet.rowDeleted()) {
        throw new SQLException("Error flushing contents of CachedRowSet object");
    }
    if (rowSet.getShowDeleted() == false && rowSet.rowDeleted()) {
        throw new SQLException("Rowset implementation is unable to determine whether rows marked for deletion are visible");
    }
    rowSet.rowSetChanged();
}
```

This method first calls the `release()` method to release the current contents of the row set. It then checks if the `getShowDeleted()` method returns true and if any rows have been deleted using the `rowDeleted()` method. If both conditions are true, it throws an SQLException with an error message indicating that there was an error flushing the contents of the CachedRowSet object.

It also checks if the `getShowDeleted()` method returns false and if any rows have been deleted using the `rowDeleted()` method. If both conditions are true, it throws an SQLException with an error message indicating that the rowset implementation is unable to determine whether rows marked for deletion are visible.

If no errors occur, it calls the `rowSetChanged()` method to send a rowSetChanged event to all registered listeners.
