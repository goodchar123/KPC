Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the named MBean is not found and throws an `InstanceNotFoundException` if that's the case:

```java
import javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException;
import javax.management.MBeanServer;
import javax.management.ObjectName;

public ClassLoader getClassLoaderForMBean(MBeanServer mbs, String mbeanName) throws Exception {
    ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName(mbeanName);
    ClassLoader classLoader = (ClassLoader) mbs.getClassLoaderFor(objectName);
    if (classLoader == null) {
        throw new InstanceNotFoundException("MBean not found: " + mbeanName);
    }
    return classLoader;
}
```

This updated method is similar to the previous one, but it now checks if the `ClassLoader` returned by `getClassLoaderFor` is `null`. If it is, it means that the named MBean was not found, so the method throws an `InstanceNotFoundException` with an appropriate error message. If the `ClassLoader` is not `null`, the method returns it as before.
