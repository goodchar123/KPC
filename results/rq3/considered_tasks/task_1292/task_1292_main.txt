Please write a java method that Return the ClassLoader that was used for loading the class of the named MBean.
Here's a Java method that returns the ClassLoader used for loading the class of the named MBean:

```java
import javax.management.MBeanServer;
import javax.management.ObjectName;

public ClassLoader getClassLoaderForMBean(MBeanServer mbs, String mbeanName) throws Exception {
    ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName(mbeanName);
    ClassLoader classLoader = (ClassLoader) mbs.getClassLoaderFor(objectName);
    return classLoader;
}
```

This method takes in an instance of `MBeanServer` and the name of the MBean as a `String`. It then creates an `ObjectName` instance from the MBean name and uses the `getClassLoaderFor` method of the `MBeanServer` to get the `ClassLoader` used for loading the class of the named MBean. Finally, it returns the `ClassLoader`. 

Note that this method throws an `Exception` if the MBean is not found or if there is an error getting the `ClassLoader`. You may want to handle these exceptions appropriately in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the named MBean is not found. for javax.management.MBeanServer.getClassLoaderFor(javax.management.ObjectName) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InstanceNotFoundException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the named MBean is not found and throws an `InstanceNotFoundException` if that's the case:

```java
import javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException;
import javax.management.MBeanServer;
import javax.management.ObjectName;

public ClassLoader getClassLoaderForMBean(MBeanServer mbs, String mbeanName) throws Exception {
    ObjectName objectName = new ObjectName(mbeanName);
    ClassLoader classLoader = (ClassLoader) mbs.getClassLoaderFor(objectName);
    if (classLoader == null) {
        throw new InstanceNotFoundException("MBean not found: " + mbeanName);
    }
    return classLoader;
}
```

This updated method is similar to the previous one, but it now checks if the `ClassLoader` returned by `getClassLoaderFor` is `null`. If it is, it means that the named MBean was not found, so the method throws an `InstanceNotFoundException` with an appropriate error message. If the `ClassLoader` is not `null`, the method returns it as before.
