Please write a java method that Deletes a file if it exists.
Sure, here's a Java method that deletes a file if it exists:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileDeleter {
    public static void deleteIfExists(String filePath) {
        File file = new File(filePath);
        if (file.exists()) {
            file.delete();
            System.out.println("File deleted successfully.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("File does not exist.");
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes a file path as a parameter and checks if the file exists. If it does, it deletes the file using the `delete()` method of the `File` class. If the file does not exist, it prints a message saying so.

Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the existence of a security manager and calls the appropriate `checkRead` and `checkDelete` methods before attempting to read or delete a file:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.security.AccessControlException;
import java.security.Permission;

public class FileDeleter {
    public static void deleteIfExists(String filePath) throws SecurityException {
        SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (securityManager != null) {
            try {
                securityManager.checkRead(filePath);
                securityManager.checkDelete(filePath);
            } catch (AccessControlException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Access denied", e);
            }
        }
        File file = new File(filePath);
        if (file.exists()) {
            if (file.delete()) {
                System.out.println("File deleted successfully.");
            } else {
                throw new SecurityException("Unable to delete file.");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("File does not exist.");
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists. If it does, it calls the `checkRead` and `checkDelete` methods on the file path to ensure that the current security context has the necessary permissions to read and delete the file. If either of these checks fail, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the security checks pass, the method proceeds to create a `File` object for the given file path and checks if the file exists. If it does, it attempts to delete the file using the `delete()` method of the `File` class. If the file is successfully deleted, it prints a message saying so. If the file does not exist or cannot be deleted, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

            }
        }
        File file = new File(filePath);
        if (file.exists()) {
