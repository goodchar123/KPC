
I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. Checking for a null driver instance is not necessary since the `DriverManager.registerDriver()` method does not accept null values. Therefore, if a null driver is passed to the `registerDriver()` method, it will throw a `NullPointerException` automatically. Here's the updated Java method:

```java
public void registerDriver(String driverClassName) throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {
    try {
        Class.forName(driverClassName);
    } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
        throw new LinkageError("Class not found: " + driverClassName);
    } catch (ExceptionInInitializerError e) {
        throw new ExceptionInInitializerError("Initialization failed for class: " + driverClassName);
    }
    
    DriverManager.registerDriver(new Driver());
}
```

This updated method first loads the driver class using `Class.forName()` method and catches `ClassNotFoundException` and `ExceptionInInitializerError` exceptions.

After checking for errors, the method registers the driver with the `DriverManager` using `DriverManager.registerDriver()` method.

Note that this method still throws `ClassNotFoundException` and `ExceptionInInitializerError` which should be handled appropriately.
