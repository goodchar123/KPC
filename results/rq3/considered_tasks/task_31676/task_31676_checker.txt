Is the UnsupportedAudioFileException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `UnsupportedAudioFileException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet.

Here are the fully qualified names of the Java JDK methods used in the `AudioUtils` method:

- `javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream)`
- `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)` (implicitly called by `AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream()`)

 + From response, we get: ['AudioUtils', 'javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream)', 'java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the UnsupportedAudioFileException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `UnsupportedAudioFileException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. It is thrown by the `AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream()` method and propagated up the call stack to the method's caller.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `IOException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. It is thrown by the `AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream()` method and propagated up the call stack to the method's caller.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes, the `NullPointerException` is handled in the code snippet. It is caught by the `try-catch` block in the method's caller, which is required to handle the exception because it is a checked exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `IOException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is thrown by the `read()` method of the `InputStream` class and propagated up the call stack to the `AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream()` method, which in turn throws it as an exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It can be thrown by the `read()` method of the `InputStream` class if the byte array parameter is null, but it is not explicitly handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It can be thrown by the `read()` method of the `InputStream` class if the offset or length parameters are negative or if the sum of the offset and length is greater than the length of the byte array, but it is not explicitly handled or caught in the code snippet.
