Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public void readDatagram(DatagramChannel channel) throws IOException {
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    int bytesRead;
    try {
        bytesRead = channel.read(buffer);
    } catch (AsynchronousCloseException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (ClosedByInterruptException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (ClosedChannelException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new SecurityException();
    }
    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    if (buffer.isReadOnly()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
    SocketAddress address = channel.receive(buffer);
    buffer.flip();
    String message = new String(buffer.array(), 0, buffer.limit());
    System.out.println("Received message: " + message + " from " + address);
}
```

This method first checks if the channel is open, and throws a `ClosedChannelException` if it is not. It then creates a `ByteBuffer` to hold the data, and calls the `read()` method on the channel to read the datagram into the buffer. If an exception is thrown during the read operation, it is re-thrown with the appropriate exception type.

After the read operation is complete, the method checks if the buffer is read-only, and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. It also checks if the channel has been closed by another thread, and throws a `ClosedChannelException` if it has.

Finally, the method flips the buffer and converts the data to a string using the `String` constructor. It also returns the address of the sender of the datagram.
