
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes error handling for the scenarios you mentioned:

```java
Connection conn = null;
PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
ResultSet rs = null;

try {
    conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
    String sql = "INSERT INTO mytable (column1, column2) VALUES (?, ?)";
    pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql, Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS);
    pstmt.setString(1, "value1");
    pstmt.setString(2, "value2");
    int rowsAffected = pstmt.executeUpdate();
    rs = pstmt.getGeneratedKeys();
    if (rs.next()) {
        int generatedKey = rs.getInt(1);
        System.out.println("Generated key: " + generatedKey);
    }
} catch (SQLException e) {
    if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
        // handle timeout exception
    } else {
        // handle other database access errors
    }
} finally {
    try {
        if (rs != null) {
            rs.close();
        }
        if (pstmt != null) {
            pstmt.close();
        }
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.close();
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // handle error closing resources
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we're using a try-catch-finally block to handle potential exceptions that may occur during database access. 

For the first scenario you mentioned, we're checking if a SQLException occurs during the `executeUpdate` method call, and throwing an exception if the PreparedStatement is closed or if the SQL statement returns a ResultSet object.

For the second scenario, we're checking if a SQLTimeoutException occurs during the `executeUpdate` method call, and throwing an exception if the driver has determined that the timeout value has been exceeded and has attempted to cancel the currently running Statement.

For the third scenario, we're checking if a SQLException occurs during the `next` method call on the ResultSet object, and throwing an exception if the ResultSet is closed or if a database access error occurs.

For the fourth scenario, we're checking if a SQLException occurs during the `getInt` method call on the ResultSet object, and throwing an exception if the columnIndex is not valid, if the ResultSet is closed, or if a database access error occurs. 

Finally, in the `finally` block, we're closing all resources (ResultSet, PreparedStatement, and Connection) to ensure that they are properly released and to avoid any potential memory leaks.
