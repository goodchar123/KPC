You're right, it's important to handle any potential I/O errors that may occur when using `java.io.Reader.read()`. Here's an updated version of the method that checks for and throws an `IOException` if an error occurs:

```java
public int read(char[] cbuf) throws IOException {
    int len = cbuf.length;
    int off = 0;
    int c;

    try {
        while (off < len && (c = read()) != -1) {
            cbuf[off++] = (char) c;
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while reading from the stream.", e);
    }

    return (off == 0 && c == -1) ? -1 : off;
}
```

In this updated version, we've added a `try-catch` block around the `while` loop that reads characters from the stream. If an `
