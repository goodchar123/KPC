Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the `CardTerminals` object contains any terminals before calling `waitForChange()`. If there are no terminals, it throws an `IllegalStateException`:

```java
public void waitForCardEvent(CardReader cardReader) throws CardException {
    CardTerminals cardTerminals = cardReader.getTerminals();
    try {
        List<CardTerminal> terminals = cardTerminals.list();
        if (terminals.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No card terminals found");
        }
    } catch (CardException e) {
        throw new CardException("Failed to list card terminals", e);
    }
    while (true) {
        try {
            cardTerminals.waitForChange();
            List<CardTerminal> insertions = cardTerminals.list(CardTerminals.State.CARD_INSERTION);
            List<CardTerminal> removals = cardTerminals.list(CardTerminals.State.CARD_REMOVAL);
            if (insertions.size() > 0) {
                for (CardTerminal cardTerminal : insertions) {
                    System.out.println("Card inserted in terminal: " + cardTerminal.getName());
                    // Perform actions on card insertion
                }
            }
            if (removals.size() > 0) {
                for (CardTerminal cardTerminal : removals) {
                    System.out.println("Card removed from terminal: " + cardTerminal.getName());
                    // Perform actions on card removal
                }
            }
        } catch (CardException e) {
            throw new CardException("Failed to wait for card event", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This version first checks if the list of terminals returned by `cardTerminals.list()` is empty. If it is, it throws an `IllegalStateException` with a message indicating that no card terminals were found.

If there are terminals, the method enters the infinite loop and waits for any change in the state of the card terminals using `waitForChange()`, as before. 

After the `waitForChange()` method returns, the method checks if there are any card insertions or removals by calling `list()` with the `CARD_INSERTION` and `CARD_REMOVAL` states, respectively. If there are any insertions or removals, the method prints a message indicating the name of the terminal and performs any necessary actions.
