Please write a java method that Repositions this stream to the position at the time the mark method was last called on this input stream.
Here's a Java method that repositions the stream to the position at the time the mark method was last called on this input stream:

```java
public void resetToMark(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    if (!inputStream.markSupported()) {
        throw new IOException("Mark not supported");
    }
    inputStream.reset();
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as a parameter and checks if the mark is supported by calling the `markSupported()` method. If the mark is not supported, an `IOException` is thrown. If the mark is supported, the `reset()` method is called on the `InputStream` to reposition the stream to the position at the time the mark method was last called.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this stream has not been marked or if the          mark has been invalidated. for java.io.InputStream.reset() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the stream has not been marked or if the mark has been invalidated before resetting the stream:

```java
public void resetToMark(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    if (!inputStream.markSupported()) {
        throw new IOException("Mark not supported");
    }
    try {
        inputStream.reset();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Mark has been invalidated or stream has not been marked");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the mark is supported by calling the `markSupported()` method. If the mark is not supported, an `IOException` is thrown.

If the mark is supported, the `reset()` method is called on the `InputStream`. If the mark has been invalidated or the stream has not been marked, an `IOException` is thrown with an appropriate message.
