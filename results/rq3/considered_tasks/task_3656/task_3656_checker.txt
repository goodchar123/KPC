Is the FactoryConfigurationError handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory.newInstance() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `FactoryConfigurationError` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. If an error occurs while creating the `XMLOutputFactory`, such as if the factory class cannot be found or instantiated, a `FactoryConfigurationError` will be thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XMLStreamException handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory.createXMLStreamWriter(java.io.OutputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `XMLStreamException` is handled or caught in the code snippet. The `createXMLStreamWriter` method throws an `XMLStreamException`, and the `createXMLStreamWriter` method in the code snippet declares that it throws this exception. Therefore, any code that calls this method must either handle or declare that it throws this exception. In this case, the `createXMLStreamWriter` method declares that it throws the `XMLStreamException`, so any code that calls this method must either handle this exception or declare that it throws this exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XMLStreamException handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeStartDocument() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `XMLStreamException` is not handled or caught for `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeStartDocument()` in the code snippet. If an error occurs while writing the XML content, such as if the document has already been started, a `XMLStreamException` will be thrown. However, the code snippet does not handle or catch this exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XMLStreamException handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeStartElement(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `XMLStreamException` is not handled or caught for `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeStartElement(java.lang.String)` in the code snippet. If an error occurs while writing the XML content, such as if the start element is not well-formed, a `XMLStreamException` will be thrown. However, the code snippet does not handle or catch this exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IllegalStateException handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeAttribute(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IllegalStateException` is not handled or caught for `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeAttribute(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)` in the code snippet. If an error occurs while writing the XML content, such as if the attribute is not well-formed, an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown. However, the code snippet does not handle or catch this exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XMLStreamException handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeAttribute(java.lang.String,java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `XMLStreamException` is not handled or caught for `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeAttribute(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)` in the code snippet. If an error occurs while writing the XML content, such as if the attribute is not well-formed, a `XMLStreamException` will be thrown. However, the code snippet does not handle or catch this exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XMLStreamException handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeCharacters(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `XMLStreamException` is not handled or caught for `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeCharacters(java.lang.String)` in the code snippet. If an error occurs while writing the XML content, such as if the characters are not well-formed, a `XMLStreamException` will be thrown. However, the code snippet does not handle or catch this exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XMLStreamException handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeEndElement() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `XMLStreamException` is not handled or caught for `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeEndElement()` in the code snippet. If an error occurs while writing the XML content, such as if the end element is not well-formed, a `XMLStreamException` will be thrown. However, the code snippet does not handle or catch this exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XMLStreamException handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeEndDocument() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `XMLStreamException` is not handled or caught for `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.writeEndDocument()` in the code snippet. If an error occurs while writing the XML content, such as if the document is not well-formed, a `XMLStreamException` will be thrown. However, the code snippet does not handle or catch this exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XMLStreamException handled or caught for javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `XMLStreamException` is handled or caught for `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter.close()` in the code snippet. The `close()` method throws an `XMLStreamException`, and the `createXMLStreamWriter` method in the code snippet declares that it throws this exception. Therefore, any code that calls this method must either handle or declare that it throws this exception. In this case, the `createXMLStreamWriter` method declares that it throws the `XMLStreamException`, so any code that calls this method must either handle this exception or declare that it throws this exception. The code snippet handles this exception by calling the `close()` method in a `finally` block, which ensures that the `XMLStreamWriter` is closed even if an exception is thrown.
