
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for database access errors and closed result sets for both `isClosed()` and `getStatement()` methods:

```java
public Statement getStatementFromResultSet(ResultSet resultSet) throws SQLException {
    try {
        if (resultSet.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error checking if result set is closed", e);
    }
    Statement statement = null;
    try {
        statement = resultSet.getStatement();
        if (statement == null) {
            throw new SQLException("Result set was not produced by a statement");
        }
        if (statement.getConnection().isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving statement from result set", e);
    }
    return statement;
}
```

This updated method uses try-catch blocks to catch SQLExceptions that may occur when calling the `isClosed()` and `getStatement()` methods.

For `isClosed()`, it catches any SQLException that may occur and throws a new SQLException with an appropriate error message and the original exception as the cause.

For `getStatement()`, it first initializes the `statement` variable to null, then tries to retrieve the Statement object using the `getStatement()` method. If the Statement object is null, it throws a SQLException with an appropriate error message. If the connection associated with the Statement object is closed, it throws a SQLException with an appropriate error message.

If any SQLException occurs during the `getStatement()` method, it catches the exception and throws a new SQLException with an appropriate error message and the original exception as the cause.

If no SQLExceptions occur, the method returns the Statement object.
