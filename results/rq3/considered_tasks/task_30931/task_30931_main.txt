Please write a java method that Obtains a MIDI sequence from the input stream provided.
Sure, here's an example Java method that obtains a MIDI sequence from an input stream:

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public static Sequence getMidiSequenceFromInputStream(InputStream inputStream) throws InvalidMidiDataException, IOException {
    Sequence sequence = MidiSystem.getSequence(inputStream);
    return sequence;
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as input and returns a `Sequence` object. It uses the `MidiSystem.getSequence()` method to obtain the MIDI sequence from the input stream. The method throws `InvalidMidiDataException` and `IOException` if there are any issues with the input stream or the MIDI data.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if stream is null for javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem.getSequence(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
You're right, it's important to check if the input stream is null before calling `MidiSystem.getSequence()`. Here's the updated code snippet that includes the null check:

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public static Sequence getMidiSequenceFromInputStream(InputStream inputStream) throws InvalidMidiDataException, IOException {
    if (inputStream == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Input stream cannot be null");
    }
    Sequence sequence = MidiSystem.getSequence(inputStream);
    return sequence;
}
```

This updated method first checks if the input stream is null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. Otherwise, it proceeds to obtain the MIDI sequence from the input stream using `MidiSystem.getSequence()`.
