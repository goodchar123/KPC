Sure, here's an updated version of the `connect()` method that checks for `null` service URL and security exceptions:

```java
public void connect() throws IOException {
    if (jmxConnector == null) {
        if (jmxUrl == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("JMX service URL is null");
        }
        JMXServiceURL url = new JMXServiceURL(jmxUrl);
        try {
            jmxConnector = JMXConnectorFactory.connect(url, jmxEnv);
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("Cannot connect to JMX server for security reasons", e);
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if the `jmxUrl` field is `null` and throw a `NullPointerException` if it is. Then, we try to establish the connection using `JMXConnectorFactory.connect()` and catch any `SecurityException` that may be thrown. If a `SecurityException` is caught, we re-throw it with a more descriptive message.
