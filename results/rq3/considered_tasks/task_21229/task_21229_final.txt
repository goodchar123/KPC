
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes all the necessary error checking:

```java
public void moveToPreviousRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("The result set is closed.");
    }
    int type;
    try {
        type = rs.getType();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("A database access error occurred while getting the result set type.", e);
    }
    if (type == ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY) {
        throw new SQLException("The result set type is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY.");
    }
    try {
        if (rs.previous()) {
            // do something with the current row
        } else {
            // handle case where there is no previous row
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("The JDBC driver does not support moving the cursor to the previous row.");
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the ResultSet object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the ResultSet is closed, it throws a `SQLException`. Next, it gets the type of the ResultSet using the `getType()` method inside a try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that may occur. If a `SQLException` is caught, it throws a new `SQLException` with a message indicating that a database access error occurred while getting the result set type.

If the ResultSet is not closed and the type is not `TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`, the method uses the `previous()` method to move the cursor to the previous row. If there is a previous row, the method can perform some action on that row. If there is no previous row, the method can handle that case appropriately.

If a `SQLException` is thrown while executing the method, it checks if the error code is 0, which indicates that the JDBC driver does not support the `previous()` method. In this case, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`. If the error code is not 0, it rethrows the `SQLException`.
