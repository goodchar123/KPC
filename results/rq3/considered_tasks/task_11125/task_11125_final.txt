Here's an updated version of the `writeBytesToFile` method that includes the requested checks:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;

public class FileChannelWriter {
    public static void writeBytesToFile(Path filePath, long position, byte[] bytes) throws IOException {
        try (FileChannel channel = FileChannel.open(filePath, StandardOpenOption.WRITE)) {
            if (!channel.isOpen()) {
                throw new ClosedChannelException();
            }
            if (position < 0) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Position cannot be negative");
            }
            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(bytes);
            int bytesWritten = channel.write(buffer, position);
            if (bytesWritten != bytes.length) {
                throw new IOException("Could not write all bytes to file");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following checks:

- `if (!channel.isOpen())`: This checks if the channel is closed before attempting to write to it. If the channel is closed, a `ClosedChannelException` is thrown.
- `if (position < 0)`: This checks if the new position is negative. If the position is negative, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- `int bytesWritten = channel.write(buffer, position)`: This writes the bytes to the channel at the given position and returns the number of bytes written. If an I/O error occurs, an `IOException` is thrown.
- `if (bytesWritten != bytes.length)`: This checks if all the bytes were written to the file. If not, an `IOException` is thrown.

These checks help ensure that the method behaves correctly and handles errors appropriately.
