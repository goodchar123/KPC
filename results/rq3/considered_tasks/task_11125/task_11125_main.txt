Please write a java method that Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer, starting at the given file position.
Here's an example Java method that writes a sequence of bytes to a channel from a given buffer, starting at a given file position:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;

public class FileChannelWriter {
    public static void writeBytesToFile(Path filePath, long position, byte[] bytes) throws IOException {
        try (FileChannel channel = FileChannel.open(filePath, StandardOpenOption.WRITE)) {
            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(bytes);
            channel.position(position);
            channel.write(buffer);
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes in three parameters:

- `filePath`: the path to the file to write to
- `position`: the position in the file to start writing from
- `bytes`: the sequence of bytes to write to the file

The method opens a `FileChannel` to the file using the `StandardOpenOption.WRITE` option, which allows the channel to be used for writing. It then creates a `ByteBuffer` from the `bytes` array and sets the channel's position to the given `position`. Finally, it writes the bytes from the buffer to the channel using the `write` method.

Note that this method throws an `IOException` if there is an error while writing to the file. You may want to handle this exception in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If this channel is closed for java.nio.channels.FileChannel.position(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ClosedChannelException.
Please check If the new position is negative for java.nio.channels.FileChannel.position(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check If some other I/O error occurs for java.nio.channels.FileChannel.position(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Here's an updated version of the `writeBytesToFile` method that includes the requested checks:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;

public class FileChannelWriter {
    public static void writeBytesToFile(Path filePath, long position, byte[] bytes) throws IOException {
        try (FileChannel channel = FileChannel.open(filePath, StandardOpenOption.WRITE)) {
            if (!channel.isOpen()) {
                throw new ClosedChannelException();
            }
            if (position < 0) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Position cannot be negative");
            }
            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(bytes);
            int bytesWritten = channel.write(buffer, position);
            if (bytesWritten != bytes.length) {
                throw new IOException("Could not write all bytes to file");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following checks:

- `if (!channel.isOpen())`: This checks if the channel is closed before attempting to write to it. If the channel is closed, a `ClosedChannelException` is thrown.
- `if (position < 0)`: This checks if the new position is negative. If the position is negative, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- `int bytesWritten = channel.write(buffer, position)`: This writes the bytes to the channel at the given position and returns the number of bytes written. If an I/O error occurs, an `IOException` is thrown.
- `if (bytesWritten != bytes.length)`: This checks if all the bytes were written to the file. If not, an `IOException` is thrown.

These checks help ensure that the method behaves correctly and handles errors appropriately.
