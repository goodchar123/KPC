Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public void readDatagram(DatagramChannel channel) throws IOException {
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    if (buffer.isReadOnly()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Buffer is read-only");
    }
    SocketAddress address = channel.receive(buffer);
    if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
        channel.close();
        throw new ClosedByInterruptException();
    }
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new AsynchronousCloseException();
    }
    if (address == null) {
        return;
    }
    buffer.flip();
    String message = new String(buffer.array(), 0, buffer.limit());
    System.out.println("Received message: " + message + " from " + address);
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        try {
            sm.checkListen(address.getPort());
        } catch (SecurityException se) {
            throw se;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following checks:

- It checks if the channel is closed before attempting to read from it, and throws a `ClosedChannelException` if it is closed.
- It checks if the buffer is read-only before attempting to read into it, and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is read-only.
- It checks if the current thread has been interrupted while the read operation is in progress, and if so, closes the channel and throws a `ClosedByInterruptException`.
- It checks if the channel is closed by another thread while the read operation is in progress, and if so, throws an `AsynchronousCloseException`.
- It checks if the received datagram is null, and if so, returns without doing anything.
- It checks if a security manager is installed and denies the operation, and if so, throws a `SecurityException`.
