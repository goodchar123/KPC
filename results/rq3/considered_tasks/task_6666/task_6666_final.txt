Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for exceptions and throws them if necessary:

```java
public static int getFieldValue(LocalDateTime dateTime, ChronoField field) {
    try {
        return dateTime.get(field);
    } catch (DateTimeException | UnsupportedTemporalTypeException | ArithmeticException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur when getting the field value from the `LocalDateTime` object. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown using the `throw` keyword.

The `DateTimeException` is thrown if a value for the field cannot be obtained or the value is outside the range of valid values for the field. The `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` is thrown if the field is not supported or the range of values exceeds an int. The `ArithmeticException` is thrown if numeric overflow occurs.

By throwing these exceptions, the calling code can handle them appropriately and take necessary actions.
