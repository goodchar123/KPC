Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the checks you requested:

```java
public static void deRegisterShutdownHook(Thread hook) {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("shutdownHooks"));
    }
    if (Runtime.getRuntime().removeShutdownHook(hook)) {
        // Hook was successfully removed
    } else {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Shutdown in progress");
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager is present, and if so, it checks if it has permission to remove shutdown hooks. If the security manager denies the permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

Next, the method calls `removeShutdownHook()` on the `Runtime` object to remove the specified hook. If the hook was successfully removed, the method continues execution. If the hook was not removed because the virtual machine is already in the process of shutting down, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.
