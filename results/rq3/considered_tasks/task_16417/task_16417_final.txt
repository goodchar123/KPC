Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()`, and throws a `SecurityException` if it's not allowed:

```
public void acquireReadLock() throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
    }
    try {
        lock.readLock().lockInterruptibly();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a `SecurityManager` is installed, it checks if the current thread has the `modifyThread` permission using `securityManager.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"))`. If the permission is not granted, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the permission is granted, the method proceeds to acquire the read lock using `lock.readLock().lockInterruptibly()`, and handles the `InterruptedException` as before.

Note that the `modifyThread` permission is required to modify any thread, including the current thread. So if the current thread doesn't have this permission, it won't be able to interrupt itself.
