Please write a java method that Acquires the read lock unless the current thread is interrupted.
Here's a Java method that acquires the read lock unless the current thread is interrupted:

```
public void acquireReadLock() {
    try {
        lock.readLock().lockInterruptibly();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
}
```

This method uses the `lockInterruptibly()` method of the `ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock` class to acquire the read lock. This method will block the current thread until the lock is available, but it will also respond to interruption by throwing an `InterruptedException`. 

In the catch block, we re-interrupt the current thread by calling `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()` so that the interruption is not lost.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread cannot modify this thread for java.lang.Thread.interrupt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()`, and throws a `SecurityException` if it's not allowed:

```
public void acquireReadLock() throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
    }
    try {
        lock.readLock().lockInterruptibly();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a `SecurityManager` is installed, it checks if the current thread has the `modifyThread` permission using `securityManager.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"))`. If the permission is not granted, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the permission is granted, the method proceeds to acquire the read lock using `lock.readLock().lockInterruptibly()`, and handles the `InterruptedException` as before.

Note that the `modifyThread` permission is required to modify any thread, including the current thread. So if the current thread doesn't have this permission, it won't be able to interrupt itself.
