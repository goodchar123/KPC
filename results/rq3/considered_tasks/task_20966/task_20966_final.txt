
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
public boolean isMultipleTransactionsSupported(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
    if (connection.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    
    try {
        DatabaseMetaData metaData = connection.getMetaData();
        if (metaData == null) {
            throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve database metadata");
        }
        return metaData.supportsMultipleTransactions();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving database metadata: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the connection is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

Next, the method tries to retrieve the `DatabaseMetaData` object using the `getMetaData()` method. If this method returns `null`, it means that there was an error retrieving the metadata, so the method throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

Finally, the method calls the `supportsMultipleTransactions()` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` object to determine whether the database supports multiple transactions. If this method throws a `SQLException`, the method catches it and throws a new `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

By checking for these potential errors and throwing `SQLExceptions` with informative messages, this method provides better error handling and helps to identify the root cause of any issues that may arise.
