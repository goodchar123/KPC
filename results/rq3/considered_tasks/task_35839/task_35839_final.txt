
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested exception handling:

```java
import java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment;
import java.awt.SplashScreen;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URL;

public class SplashScreenChanger {
    public static void changeSplashScreenImage(String imagePath) throws HeadlessException, UnsupportedOperationException, NullPointerException, IOException, IllegalStateException {
        if (GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()) {
            throw new HeadlessException();
        }
        SplashScreen splash = SplashScreen.getSplashScreen();
        if (splash == null) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
        }
        URL imageURL = SplashScreenChanger.class.getResource(imagePath);
        if (imageURL == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Image URL is null for path: " + imagePath);
        }
        try {
            splash.setImageURL(imageURL);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error loading image: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Splash screen has already been closed");
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Image URL is null for path: " + imagePath);
        }
    }
}
```

This method now includes exception handling for the following scenarios:

- If the current toolkit does not support the splash screen feature, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown.
- If `GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()` returns true, indicating that the system is running in a headless environment, a `HeadlessException` is thrown.
- If the `imageURL` parameter is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating the path that was used to load the image.
- If there is an error while loading the image, an `IOException` is thrown with a message indicating the error that occurred.
- If the splash screen has already been closed, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown with a message indicating that the splash screen has already been closed.
- If the `imageURL` parameter is null when calling `setImageURL()`, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating the path that was used to load the image.

Note that each exception is thrown with an appropriate message to help identify the issue.
