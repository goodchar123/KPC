Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for null values and throws `NullPointerException` if necessary:

```java
import javax.script.*;

public class JavaScriptObject {
    public static Object getMember(String objectName, String memberName) throws ScriptException {
        if (objectName == null || memberName == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Object name and member name cannot be null.");
        }
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("JavaScript");
        if (engine == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Script engine not found.");
        }
        engine.eval(objectName + " = {name: 'John', age: 30};"); // create a JavaScript object
        Object member = engine.eval(objectName + "." + memberName); // retrieve the named member
        return member;
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we first check if either `objectName` or `memberName` is null, and if so, we throw a `NullPointerException` with an appropriate message.

We also check if the `ScriptEngine` object returned by `getEngineByName` is null, and if so, we throw a `NullPointerException` with a message indicating that the script engine was not found.

These checks ensure that the method is called with valid arguments and that the script engine is available before attempting to evaluate JavaScript code.
