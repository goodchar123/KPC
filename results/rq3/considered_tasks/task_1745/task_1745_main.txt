Please write a java method that Retrieves a named member of a JavaScript object.
Here's a Java method that retrieves a named member of a JavaScript object:

```java
import javax.script.*;

public class JavaScriptObject {
    public static Object getMember(String objectName, String memberName) throws ScriptException {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("JavaScript");
        engine.eval(objectName + " = {name: 'John', age: 30};"); // create a JavaScript object
        Object member = engine.eval(objectName + "." + memberName); // retrieve the named member
        return member;
    }
}
```

This method uses the `ScriptEngine` class from the `javax.script` package to evaluate JavaScript code. It creates a JavaScript object with the specified name and retrieves the named member using the dot notation. The method returns the value of the named member as an `Object`. 

To use this method, you can call it like this:

```java
try {
    Object member = JavaScriptObject.getMember("person", "name");
    System.out.println(member); // prints "John"
} catch (ScriptException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, the `getMember` method is called with the object name "person" and the member name "name". The method retrieves the "name" member from the JavaScript object and returns its value, which is then printed to the console.

Please check if shortName is null. for javax.script.ScriptEngineManager.getEngineByName(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if the argument is null. for javax.script.ScriptEngine.eval(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for null values and throws `NullPointerException` if necessary:

```java
import javax.script.*;

public class JavaScriptObject {
    public static Object getMember(String objectName, String memberName) throws ScriptException {
        if (objectName == null || memberName == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Object name and member name cannot be null.");
        }
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("JavaScript");
        if (engine == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Script engine not found.");
        }
        engine.eval(objectName + " = {name: 'John', age: 30};"); // create a JavaScript object
        Object member = engine.eval(objectName + "." + memberName); // retrieve the named member
        return member;
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we first check if either `objectName` or `memberName` is null, and if so, we throw a `NullPointerException` with an appropriate message.

We also check if the `ScriptEngine` object returned by `getEngineByName` is null, and if so, we throw a `NullPointerException` with a message indicating that the script engine was not found.

These checks ensure that the method is called with valid arguments and that the script engine is available before attempting to evaluate JavaScript code.
