Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks for both `contains` and `remove` methods:

```java
public static <T> boolean removeElement(Collection<T> collection, T element) {
    if (collection == null) {
        return false;
    }
    if (element == null && !collection.contains(null)) {
        throw new NullPointerException("This collection does not permit null elements");
    }
    if (!collection.contains(element)) {
        return false;
    }
    try {
        return collection.remove(element);
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        throw new ClassCastException("Element is of incompatible type with this collection");
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Remove operation is not supported by this collection");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        throw new NullPointerException("This collection does not permit null elements");
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the collection is null, and if so, it returns false. It then checks if the element is null and if the collection permits null elements using the `contains` method. If the element is null and the collection does not permit null elements, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating the issue.

If the element is not null or the collection permits null elements, the method checks if the collection contains the element using the `contains` method. If the element is not found in the collection, the method returns false.

If the element is found in the collection, the method attempts to remove it using the `remove` method. If the element's type is incompatible with the collection, a `ClassCastException` is thrown with a message indicating the issue. If the remove operation is not supported by the collection, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown with a message indicating the issue. If the element is null and the collection does not permit null elements, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating the issue.

If the remove operation is successful, the method returns true.
