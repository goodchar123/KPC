Please write a java method that Sets the maximum number of edits this UndoManager holds.
Sure, here's a Java method that sets the maximum number of edits an UndoManager can hold:

```java
public void setMaxEdits(UndoManager undoManager, int maxEdits) {
    undoManager.setLimit(maxEdits);
}
```

This method takes an UndoManager object and an integer value for the maximum number of edits to hold. It then calls the `setLimit` method on the UndoManager object, passing in the maxEdits value to set the maximum number of edits the UndoManager can hold.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this UndoManager is not in progress                          (end has been invoked) for javax.swing.undo.UndoManager.setLimit(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw RuntimeException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the UndoManager is not in progress before setting the maximum number of edits it can hold:

```java
public void setMaxEdits(UndoManager undoManager, int maxEdits) {
    if (!undoManager.isInProgress()) {
        undoManager.setLimit(maxEdits);
    } else {
        throw new RuntimeException("Cannot set limit while UndoManager is in progress.");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the UndoManager is not in progress by calling the `isInProgress` method on the UndoManager object. If it is not in progress, it sets the maximum number of edits the UndoManager can hold by calling the `setLimit` method on the UndoManager object, passing in the `maxEdits` value. If the UndoManager is in progress, it throws a `RuntimeException` with a message indicating that the limit cannot be set while the UndoManager is in progress.
