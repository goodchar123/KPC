
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the existence of a security manager and calls its `checkPrintJobAccess()` method to ensure that the current thread is allowed to create a print job request:

```java
public void setPageFormatAndPainter(int pageNumber, PageFormat pageFormat, Printable painter) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPrintJobAccess();
    }
    PrinterJob job = PrinterJob.getPrinterJob();
    job.setPrintable(painter, pageFormat);
    try {
        job.print(new HashPrintRequestAttributeSet(), new SimpleDoc(null, job.getPrintService().getSupportedDocFlavors()[0], null), new PageRanges(pageNumber, pageNumber), null);
    } catch (PrinterException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager exists, it calls its `checkPrintJobAccess()` method to ensure that the current thread is allowed to create a print job request. If the security manager disallows the request, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If there is no security manager or the security manager allows the request, the method proceeds to create the PrinterJob object and set the painter and page format as before.
