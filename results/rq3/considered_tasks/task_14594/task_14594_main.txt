Please write a java method that Returns true if the next token in this scanner's input can be interpreted as a BigInteger in the specified radix using the nextBigInteger() method.
Here's the Java method that returns true if the next token in the scanner's input can be interpreted as a BigInteger in the specified radix using the nextBigInteger() method:

```java
public static boolean hasNextBigIntegerInRadix(Scanner scanner, int radix) {
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        return false;
    }
    String nextToken = scanner.next();
    try {
        new BigInteger(nextToken, radix);
        return true;
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

This method takes a Scanner object and an integer radix as parameters. It first checks if there is a next token in the scanner's input. If there isn't, it returns false. If there is, it retrieves the next token using the scanner's next() method.

The method then tries to create a new BigInteger object using the next token and the specified radix. If this succeeds, it means that the next token can be interpreted as a BigInteger in the specified radix, so the method returns true. If an exception is thrown, it means that the next token cannot be interpreted as a BigInteger in the specified radix, so the method returns false.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNext() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if no more tokens are available for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static boolean hasNextBigIntegerInRadix(Scanner scanner, int radix) {
    if (scanner == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Scanner cannot be null");
    }
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No more tokens available");
    }
    String nextToken = scanner.next();
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    try {
        new BigInteger(nextToken, radix);
        return true;
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the scanner parameter is null. If it is, it throws an IllegalArgumentException with an appropriate message.

Next, it checks if the scanner has encountered an IOException. If it has, it means that the scanner is closed, so it throws an IllegalStateException with an appropriate message.

Then, it checks if there is a next token in the scanner's input. If there isn't, it throws a NoSuchElementException with an appropriate message.

After retrieving the next token, the method checks again if the scanner has encountered an IOException. If it has, it means that the scanner is closed, so it throws an IllegalStateException with an appropriate message.

Finally, the method tries to create a new BigInteger object using the next token and the specified radix. If this succeeds, it means that the next token can be interpreted as a BigInteger in the specified radix, so the method returns true. If an exception is thrown, it means that the next token cannot be interpreted as a BigInteger in the specified radix, so the method returns false.
