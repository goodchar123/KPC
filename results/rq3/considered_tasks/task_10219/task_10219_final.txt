Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for both cases:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class FileHandler {
    public static void readBytesFromFile(File file, byte[] b) throws IOException {
        if (b == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Byte array cannot be null");
        }
        try (RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, "r")) {
            int bytesRead = raf.read(b);
            if (bytesRead == -1) {
                throw new EOFException("End of file reached");
            } else if (bytesRead != b.length) {
                throw new IOException("Could not read all bytes from file");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the byte array `b` is null. If it is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message "Byte array cannot be null". If `b` is not null, the method proceeds to read bytes from the file into the byte array using the `RandomAccessFile.read(byte[])` method.

After the read operation, the method checks the return value of `read` to see if the end of file has been reached. If `read` returns -1, it means that the end of file has been reached, so an `EOFException` is thrown with a message "End of file reached".

If `read` returns a value other than -1, the method checks if the number of bytes read is equal to the length of the byte array `b`. If they are not equal, it means that not all bytes were read from the file, so an `IOException` is thrown with a message "Could not read all bytes from file".

Finally, the `try-with-resources` statement is used to automatically close the `RandomAccessFile` after the read operation is complete.
