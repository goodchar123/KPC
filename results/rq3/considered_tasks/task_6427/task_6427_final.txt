Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public static int getTimeFieldAsInt(LocalTime time, ChronoField field) {
    try {
        return time.get(field);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Value for field " + field + " cannot be obtained or is outside the range of valid values for the field", e);
    } catch (UnsupportedTemporalTypeException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException("Field " + field + " is not supported or the range of values exceeds an int", e);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while getting the value of field " + field);
    }
}
```

This updated method includes a try-catch block that catches any potential exceptions that may occur when calling the `get` method on the `time` object with the specified `field`.

If a `DateTimeException` is caught, it means that the value for the field cannot be obtained or is outside the range of valid values for the field, so a new `DateTimeException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the field name and the original exception as the cause.

If an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` is caught, it means that the field is not supported or the range of values exceeds an int, so a new `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the field name and the original exception as the cause.

If an `ArithmeticException` is caught, it means that numeric overflow occurred while getting the value of the field, so a new `ArithmeticException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the field name.
