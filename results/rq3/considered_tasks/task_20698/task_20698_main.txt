Please write a java method that Retrieves the character position at which the specified substring searchstr appears in the SQL CLOB value represented by this Clob object.
Here's a Java method that retrieves the character position at which the specified substring `searchstr` appears in the SQL CLOB value represented by a `Clob` object:

```java
public int getClobSubstringPosition(Clob clob, String searchstr) throws SQLException {
    Reader reader = clob.getCharacterStream();
    int position = -1;
    int index = 0;
    int searchLength = searchstr.length();
    char[] buffer = new char[searchLength];
    int charsRead = reader.read(buffer);
    while (charsRead != -1) {
        String bufferStr = new String(buffer, 0, charsRead);
        int foundIndex = bufferStr.indexOf(searchstr);
        if (foundIndex != -1) {
            position = index + foundIndex;
            break;
        }
        index += charsRead;
        charsRead = reader.read(buffer);
    }
    return position;
}
```

This method takes a `Clob` object and a `String` `searchstr` as input parameters. It returns an `int` value representing the character position at which the specified substring `searchstr` appears in the SQL CLOB value represented by the `Clob` object.

The method first gets a `Reader` object from the `Clob` using the `getCharacterStream()` method. It then reads the CLOB data into a character buffer of the same length as the search string. It searches for the search string in the buffer using the `indexOf()` method. If the search string is found, it calculates the position of the search string in the CLOB data and returns it. If the search string is not found in the current buffer, it reads the next buffer of data from the CLOB and continues the search until the end of the CLOB is reached or the search string is found. If the search string is not found in the entire CLOB, the method returns -1.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if there is an error accessing the         CLOB value for java.sql.Clob.getCharacterStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver         does not support this method for java.sql.Clob.getCharacterStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.Reader.read(char[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes error handling for the scenarios you mentioned:

```java
public int getClobSubstringPosition(Clob clob, String searchstr) throws SQLException, IOException {
    Reader reader = null;
    try {
        reader = clob.getCharacterStream();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error accessing the CLOB value", e);
    }
    if (reader == null) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("JDBC driver does not support getCharacterStream() method for CLOB");
    }
    int position = -1;
    int index = 0;
    int searchLength = searchstr.length();
    char[] buffer = new char[searchLength];
    int charsRead = -1;
    try {
        charsRead = reader.read(buffer);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("I/O error occurred while reading CLOB data", e);
    }
    while (charsRead != -1) {
        String bufferStr = new String(buffer, 0, charsRead);
        int foundIndex = bufferStr.indexOf(searchstr);
        if (foundIndex != -1) {
            position = index + foundIndex;
            break;
        }
        index += charsRead;
        try {
            charsRead = reader.read(buffer);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("I/O error occurred while reading CLOB data", e);
        }
    }
    return position;
}
```

This updated method includes try-catch blocks to handle the exceptions that may occur while accessing the CLOB data. 

If there is an error accessing the CLOB value for `getCharacterStream()` method, the method throws a `SQLException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause.

If the JDBC driver does not support the `getCharacterStream()` method for CLOB, the method throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with a custom error message.

If an I/O error occurs while reading the CLOB data using the `read(char[])` method, the method throws an `IOException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause.
