Yes, you can modify the code snippet I provided to check for I/O errors while writing to the underlying `OutputStream` for `ObjectOutputStream.defaultWriteObject()`. Here's an updated version of the method:

```
public void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
    try {
        out.defaultWriteObject();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // If an I/O error occurs while writing to the stream, throw an IOException
        throw new IOException("Error writing object to stream", e);
    }
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur while writing to the stream. If an `IOException` is caught, it is re-thrown as a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. This way, the caller of the method can handle the exception appropriately.
