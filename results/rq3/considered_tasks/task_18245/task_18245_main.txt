Please write a java method that Logout the user  This method removes the Principals associated with the Subject.
Sure, here's an example Java method that logs out a user by removing the Principals associated with the Subject:

```java
import javax.security.auth.Subject;

public void logoutUser(Subject subject) {
    subject.getPrincipals().clear();
}
```

This method takes a `Subject` object as a parameter and removes all the Principals associated with it by calling the `clear()` method on the `Principals` collection. This effectively logs out the user by removing their identity from the Subject.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the clear method         is not supported by this set for java.util.Set.clear() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the `clear()` method is supported by the `Principals` set and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it's not:

```java
import javax.security.auth.Subject;

public void logoutUser(Subject subject) {
    if (subject.getPrincipals() instanceof java.util.Set) {
        java.util.Set<java.security.Principal> principals = (java.util.Set<java.security.Principal>) subject.getPrincipals();
        if (principals != null) {
            try {
                principals.clear();
            } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
                // clear() method not supported by the set
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Cannot clear Principals set", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `Principals` set is an instance of `java.util.Set`. If it is, it casts the set to a `Set<Principal>` and attempts to call the `clear()` method on it. If the `clear()` method is not supported by the set, it throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` with a message indicating that the Principals set cannot be cleared.
