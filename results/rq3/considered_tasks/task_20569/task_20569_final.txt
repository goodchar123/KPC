
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes error checking for the `write` and `flush` methods:

```java
public int writeBytesToBlob(Blob blob, byte[] bytes, int offset, int length) throws SQLException, IOException {
    OutputStream out = blob.setBinaryStream(offset + 1);
    try {
        out.write(bytes, offset, length);
        out.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error writing to BLOB output stream", e);
    } finally {
        if (out != null) {
            try {
                out.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error closing BLOB output stream", e);
            }
        }
    }
    return length;
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch-finally block to handle potential errors that may occur when writing to the BLOB output stream. If an error occurs during the write or flush operations, an `IOException` is thrown with a descriptive error message. The `finally` block ensures that the output stream is closed properly, even if an error occurs during the write operation.
