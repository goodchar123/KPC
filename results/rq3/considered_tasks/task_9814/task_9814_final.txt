Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the existence of a security manager and calls its `checkRead` and `checkWrite` methods to ensure that the application has the necessary permissions to read and write to the file:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.security.AccessControlException;
import java.security.Permission;

public class FileModificationTester {
    public static boolean canModify
