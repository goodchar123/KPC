Please write a java method that Atomically sets this key's interest set to the bitwise union ("or") of the existing interest set and the given value.
Here's a Java method that atomically sets a key's interest set to the bitwise union ("or") of the existing interest set and the given value:

```java
public void setInterestSet(SelectionKey key, int value) {
    int interestOps;
    int oldOps;
    do {
        oldOps = key.interestOps();
        interestOps = oldOps | value;
    } while (!key.compareAndSetInterestOps(oldOps, interestOps));
}
```

This method uses a do-while loop to atomically update the key's interest set. It first gets the current interest set using the `interestOps()` method, then calculates the new interest set by performing a bitwise OR operation with the given value. It then attempts to set the new interest set using the `compareAndSetInterestOps()` method, which atomically sets the interest set if it hasn't been changed by another thread. If the method returns `false`, indicating that another thread has modified the interest set, the loop repeats until the update is successful.

Please check If this key has been cancelled for java.nio.channels.SelectionKey.interestOps() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw CancelledKeyException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the key has been cancelled before setting the interest set:

```java
public void setInterestSet(SelectionKey key, int value) throws CancelledKeyException {
    if (!key.isValid()) {
        throw new CancelledKeyException();
    }
    int interestOps;
    int oldOps;
    do {
        oldOps = key.interestOps();
        interestOps = oldOps | value;
    } while (!key.compareAndSetInterestOps(oldOps, interestOps));
}
```

This updated method first checks if the key is valid using the `isValid()` method. If the key has been cancelled, it throws a `CancelledKeyException`. If the key is valid, it proceeds with the same logic as before to atomically update the interest set.
