Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error checking:

```java
import java.security.Permission;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class TaskExecutor {
    private final ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

    public Future<?> submitTask(Runnable task) {
        if (task == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Task cannot be null");
        }
        try {
            return executor.submit(task);
        } catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task cannot be scheduled for execution", e);
        }
    }

    public void shutdown() {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
        }
        try {
            executor.shutdown();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("Shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify", e);
        }
    }
}
```

In the `submitTask()` method, we first check if the task is null and throw a `NullPointerException` if it is. We then attempt to submit the task to the executor using the `executor.submit()` method. If the task cannot be scheduled for execution, a `RejectedExecutionException` is thrown with a message indicating that the task cannot be scheduled.

In the `shutdown()` method, we first check if a security manager exists and if so, we check if the caller has the `RuntimePermission("modifyThread")` permission. If the caller does not have this permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown with a message indicating that shutting down the executor may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify. We then attempt to shut down the executor using the `executor.shutdown()` method. If a `SecurityException` is thrown during this process, we re-throw it with a more descriptive message.
