Please write a java method that Writes an array of bytes to the uncompressed output stream.
Here's a Java method that writes an array of bytes to an uncompressed output stream:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class UncompressedOutputStreamWriter {
    
    public static void writeBytesToUncompressedStream(byte[] bytes, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
        outputStream.write(bytes);
        outputStream.flush();
    }
}
```

This method takes in two parameters: the byte array to be written and the output stream to which the bytes should be written. The `write()` method of the output stream is used to write the bytes to the stream, and the `flush()` method is called to ensure that all bytes are written to the stream. 

Note that this method may throw an `IOException` if there is an error writing to the output stream, so it's important to handle this exception appropriately.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.OutputStream.flush() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for I/O errors and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class UncompressedOutputStreamWriter {
    
    public static void writeBytesToUncompressedStream(byte[] bytes, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
        try {
            outputStream.write(bytes);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing bytes to output stream", e);
        }
        
        try {
            outputStream.flush();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error flushing output stream", e);
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, each I/O operation is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches any `IOException` that may occur. If an `IOException` is caught, a new `IOException` is thrown with a more descriptive error message and the original exception as the cause.

This way, if an I/O error occurs during the write or flush operation, the method will throw an `IOException` with a clear error message that can be used to diagnose and fix the problem.
