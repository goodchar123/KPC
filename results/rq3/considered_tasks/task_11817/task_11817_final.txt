Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for I/O errors and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class UncompressedOutputStreamWriter {
    
    public static void writeBytesToUncompressedStream(byte[] bytes, OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
        try {
            outputStream.write(bytes);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing bytes to output stream", e);
        }
        
        try {
            outputStream.flush();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error flushing output stream", e);
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, each I/O operation is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches any `IOException` that may occur. If an `IOException` is caught, a new `IOException` is thrown with a more descriptive error message and the original exception as the cause.

This way, if an I/O error occurs during the write or flush operation, the method will throw an `IOException` with a clear error message that can be used to diagnose and fix the problem.
