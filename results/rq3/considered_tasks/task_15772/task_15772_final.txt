Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks and exceptions:

```
public void addIssuerName(X509CertSelector selector, String name) {
    try {
        // Get the current issuerNames criterion
        Collection<GeneralName> issuerNames = selector.getIssuerNames();

        // Create a new GeneralName for the name to be added
        GeneralName newIssuerName = new GeneralName(GeneralName.directoryName, new X500Name(name));

        // Check if the add operation is supported by this collection
        if (!issuerNames.add(newIssuerName)) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Add operation not supported by this collection");
        }

        // Set the updated issuerNames criterion in the selector
        selector.setIssuerNames(issuerNames);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle any exceptions that may occur
        e.printStackTrace();
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        throw new ClassCastException("Class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this collection");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Specified element is null and this collection does not permit null elements");
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some property of the element prevents it from being added to this collection");
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Element cannot be added at this time due to insertion restrictions");
    }
}
```

This updated method includes checks for each of the potential exceptions that could occur when adding a new element to a collection. If any of these checks fail, the appropriate exception is thrown with a corresponding error message.
