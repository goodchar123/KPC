
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the input stream has reached the end before reading the next attribute as a boolean:

```java
public boolean readNextAttributeAsBoolean(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
    if (dataInputStream.available() == 0) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return dataInputStream.readBoolean();
}
```

This method first checks if the input stream has any bytes available to read using the `available()` method of the `DataInputStream`. If the available bytes count is zero, it means that the end of the stream has been reached, so an `EOFException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method reads the next attribute in the stream as a boolean using the `readBoolean()` method and returns it.
