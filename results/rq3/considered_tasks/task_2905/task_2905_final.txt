Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error checking for `ExecutorService.shutdown()`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CompilationTask {
    public static Future<String> compile(String sourceCode, String compilerPath, String outputDirectory) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Callable<String> task = new Callable<String>() {
            @Override
            public String call() throws Exception {
                // Compile the source code using the specified compiler and output directory
                // Return the result of the compilation as a string
                return "Compilation successful";
            }
        };
        Future<String> future;
        try {
            future = executor.submit(task);
        } catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task cannot be scheduled for execution", e);
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Task is null");
        }
        try {
            executor.shutdown();
            executor.awaitTermination(Long.MAX_VALUE, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("Shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify", e);
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("A security manager exists and shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify", e);
        }
        return future;
    }
}
```

This updated method includes an additional `catch` block to catch any `SecurityException` that may occur when calling `executor.shutdown()`. If a `SecurityException` is caught, a new exception is thrown with a more descriptive error message.

Note that this error checking assumes that the caller of the `compile()` method does not have the `RuntimePermission("modifyThread")`. If the caller does have this permission, the `SecurityException` will not be thrown.
