
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes error handling for the scenarios you mentioned:

```java
import java.io.Reader;
import java.sql.*;

public class Example {
    public Reader getParameterAsReader(Connection conn, String query, int parameterIndex) throws SQLException {
        PreparedStatement stmt = null;
        ResultSet rs = null;
        Reader reader = null;
        try {
            stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);
            stmt.setInt(parameterIndex, 1);
            rs = stmt.executeQuery();
            if (!rs.next()) {
                throw new SQLException("No rows returned from query");
            }
            reader = rs.getCharacterStream(parameterIndex);
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
                throw (SQLTimeoutException) e;
            } else {
                throw new SQLException("Error executing query", e);
            }
        } finally {
            if (rs != null) {
                try {
                    rs.close();
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    // log error or handle it as appropriate
                }
            }
            if (stmt != null) {
                try {
                    stmt.close();
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    // log error or handle it as appropriate
                }
            }
        }
        if (reader == null) {
            throw new SQLException("Error retrieving reader object");
        }
        return reader;
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we've added a try-catch block to handle any `SQLException` that may occur during the execution of the query. We've also added a check to ensure that the result set contains at least one row before attempting to retrieve the value of the designated parameter as a `Reader` object.

We've also added error handling for the scenarios you mentioned. If a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown during the execution of the query, we re-throw it. If any other `SQLException` is thrown, we wrap it in a new `SQLException` with a more descriptive error message.

Finally, we've added a `finally` block to ensure that the `ResultSet` and `PreparedStatement` objects are closed properly, even if an exception is thrown. If the `Reader` object is still null after all error handling, we throw a new `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.
