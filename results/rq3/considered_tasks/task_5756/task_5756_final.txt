Sure, here's an updated version of the `connectSocket()` method that checks for I/O errors when closing the socket and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.*;

public class SocketConnector {
    public static void connectSocket(String ipAddress, int port) throws IOException {
        Socket socket = null;
        try {
            // Create a new socket
            socket = new Socket();

            // Create a remote socket address
            InetSocketAddress remoteAddress = new InetSocketAddress(ipAddress, port);

            // Connect the socket to the remote address
            socket.connect(remoteAddress);

            // Do something with the connected socket...

        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle any exceptions that occur during socket creation or connection
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Close the socket when finished
            if (socket != null) {
                try {
                    socket.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    // Check for I/O errors when closing the socket
                    e.printStackTrace();
                    throw e;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this version of the method, we've added a `finally` block that closes the socket and checks for I/O errors. If an `IOException` occurs when closing the socket, we print the stack trace and re-throw the exception using the `throw` keyword. 

Note that we've also added the `throws IOException` clause to the method signature to indicate that this method may throw an `IOException`.
