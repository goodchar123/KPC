
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class MaxSQLLength {
    public static int getMaxSQLLength(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        
        DatabaseMetaData metaData = null;
        try {
            metaData = conn.getMetaData();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
        }
        
        int maxStatementLength = 0;
        try {
            maxStatementLength = metaData.getMaxStatementLength();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
        }
        
        return maxStatementLength;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the `Connection` object. If the connection is closed, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message.

Next, the `getMetaData()` method is called inside a try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that may occur due to a database access error.

Finally, the `getMaxStatementLength()` method is called inside another try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that may occur due to a database access error.

If either of these methods throws a `SQLException`, the method throws a new `SQLException` with an appropriate message and the original exception as the cause.
