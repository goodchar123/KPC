Please write a java method that Relative put method for writing a short value  (optional operation).
Here's an example of a Java method for the Relative put method for writing a short value:

```
public void putShort(short value) throws IOException {
    if (buffer.remaining() < 2) {
        flushBuffer();
    }
    buffer.putShort(value);
}
```

This method takes a short value as input and writes it to a buffer. If the buffer does not have enough space to write the value, the buffer is flushed and the value is written to a new buffer. The method throws an IOException if there is an error writing the value to the buffer.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If there are fewer than two bytes          remaining in this buffer for java.nio.ByteBuffer.putShort(short) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw BufferOverflowException.
Please check If this buffer is read only for java.nio.ByteBuffer.putShort(short) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ReadOnlyBufferException.
You're right, it's important to check for buffer overflow and read-only buffer exceptions when using the `putShort` method in Java. Here's an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```
public void putShort(short value) throws IOException {
    if (buffer.isReadOnly()) {
        throw new ReadOnlyBufferException();
    }
    if (buffer.remaining() < 2) {
        throw new BufferOverflowException();
    }
    buffer.putShort(value);
}
```

This method first checks if the buffer is read-only and throws a `ReadOnlyBufferException` if it is. Then it checks if there are fewer than two bytes remaining in the buffer and throws a `BufferOverflowException` if there are. Finally, if there is enough space in the buffer, it writes the short value to the buffer using the `putShort` method.
