Please write a java method that Sets the height for row to rowHeight, revalidates, and repaints.
Here's a Java method that sets the height for a row in a JTable to a specified rowHeight, revalidates the table, and repaints it:

```
public void setRowHeight(JTable table, int row, int rowHeight) {
    table.setRowHeight(row, rowHeight);
    table.revalidate();
    table.repaint();
}
```

To use this method, simply pass in the JTable object, the row index, and the desired row height as parameters. For example:

```
setRowHeight(myTable, 2, 50);
```

This would set the height of the third row in the table (since row indices start at 0) to 50 pixels.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if rowHeight is                                          less than 1 for javax.swing.JTable.setRowHeight(int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the rowHeight is less than 1 for javax.swing.JTable.setRowHeight(int,int) and throws an IllegalArgumentException if it is:

```
public void setRowHeight(JTable table, int row, int rowHeight) {
    if (rowHeight < 1) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Row height must be greater than 0");
    }
    table.setRowHeight(row, rowHeight);
    table.revalidate();
    table.repaint();
}
```

Now, if the rowHeight parameter is less than 1, the method will throw an IllegalArgumentException with the message "Row height must be greater than 0". Otherwise, it will set the row height, revalidate the table, and repaint it as before.
