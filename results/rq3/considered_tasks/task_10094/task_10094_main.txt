Please write a java method that Reads a 64 bit double.
Here's a Java method that reads a 64-bit double:

```java
import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class DoubleReader {
    public static double readDouble(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
        DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
        return dataInputStream.readDouble();
    }
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as input and returns a `double`. It uses a `DataInputStream` to read the 64-bit double from the input stream. If an `IOException` occurs while reading the input stream, it is thrown to the calling method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this input stream reaches the end before               reading eight bytes. for java.io.DataInputStream.readDouble() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw EOFException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `readDouble` method that checks if the input stream has reached the end before reading eight bytes:

```java
import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.EOFException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class DoubleReader {
    public static double readDouble(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
        DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
        if (inputStream.available() < 8) {
            throw new EOFException();
        }
        return dataInputStream.readDouble();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the input stream has at least 8 bytes available to read. If not, it throws an `EOFException`. Otherwise, it uses a `DataInputStream` to read the 64-bit double from the input stream. If an `IOException` occurs while reading the input stream, it is thrown to the calling method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.InputStream.available() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if this input stream reaches the end before               reading eight bytes. for java.io.DataInputStream.readDouble() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw EOFException.
Please check the stream has been closed and the contained             input stream does not support reading after close, or             another I/O error occurs. for java.io.DataInputStream.readDouble() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `readDouble` method that checks for all the conditions you mentioned:

```java
import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.EOFException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class DoubleReader {
    public static double readDouble(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
        if (inputStream == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Input stream is null");
        }
        if (inputStream instanceof DataInputStream) {
            inputStream = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream);
        }
        int availableBytes = inputStream.available();
        if (availableBytes < 8) {
            throw new EOFException("Not enough bytes available to read a double");
        }
        DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
        double value;
        try {
            value = dataInputStream.readDouble();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading double value", e);
        }
        if (inputStream.available() != availableBytes - 8) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading double value: input stream has been closed or does not support reading after close");
        }
        return value;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the input stream is null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. If the input stream is a `DataInputStream`, it wraps it in a `PushbackInputStream` to prevent it from being closed. It then checks if there are at least 8 bytes available to read and throws an `EOFException` if there aren't. It uses a `DataInputStream` to read the 64-bit double from the input stream and catches any `IOException` that occurs while doing so, throwing a new `IOException` with a more descriptive message. Finally, it checks if the input stream has been closed or does not support reading after close and throws an `IOException` if it has.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.InputStream.available() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `readDouble` method that checks for an `IOException` when calling `available()` on the input stream:

```java
import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.EOFException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class DoubleReader {
    public static double readDouble(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
        if (inputStream == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Input stream is null");
        }
        if (inputStream instanceof DataInputStream) {
            inputStream = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream);
        }
        int availableBytes;
        try {
            availableBytes = inputStream.available();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error checking available bytes", e);
        }
        if (availableBytes < 8) {
            throw new EOFException("Not enough bytes available to read a double");
        }
        DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
        double value;
        try {
            value = dataInputStream.readDouble();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading double value", e);
        }
        if (inputStream.available() != availableBytes - 8) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading double value: input stream has been closed or does not support reading after close");
        }
        return value;
    }
}
```

This updated method wraps the call to `inputStream.available()` in a try-catch block and throws an `IOException` with a more descriptive message if an `IOException` occurs.
