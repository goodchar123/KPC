Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the `clear()` operation is supported by the collection and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it's not:

```java
public void removeAllElements(Collection<?> collection) {
    if (collection instanceof List) {
        ((List<?>) collection).clear();
    } else {
        try {
            collection.clear();
        } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Clear operation is not supported by this collection", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the collection is an instance of `List`, which is a subtype of `Collection` that supports the `clear()` operation. If it is, the method calls `clear()` directly on the list.

If the collection is not a list, the method tries to call `clear()` on it. If the operation is not supported, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown with a message indicating that the clear operation is not supported by the collection. The original exception is passed as a cause of the new exception for debugging purposes.
