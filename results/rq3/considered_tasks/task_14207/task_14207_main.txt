Please write a java method that Removes all of the elements from this collection (optional operation).
Here's a Java method that removes all elements from a collection:

```java
public void removeAllElements(Collection<?> collection) {
    collection.clear();
}
```

This method takes a collection as a parameter and calls the `clear()` method on it to remove all elements. The `clear()` method is an optional operation that removes all elements from the collection.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the clear operation         is not supported by this collection for java.util.Collection.clear() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the `clear()` operation is supported by the collection and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it's not:

```java
public void removeAllElements(Collection<?> collection) {
    if (collection instanceof List) {
        ((List<?>) collection).clear();
    } else {
        try {
            collection.clear();
        } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Clear operation is not supported by this collection", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the collection is an instance of `List`, which is a subtype of `Collection` that supports the `clear()` operation. If it is, the method calls `clear()` directly on the list.

If the collection is not a list, the method tries to call `clear()` on it. If the operation is not supported, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown with a message indicating that the clear operation is not supported by the collection. The original exception is passed as a cause of the new exception for debugging purposes.
