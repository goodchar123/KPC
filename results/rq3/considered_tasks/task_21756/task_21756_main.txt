Please write a java method that Interrupts a running invoke.
Here's an example Java method that interrupts a running invoke:

```java
public void interruptInvoke(Thread thread) {
    if (thread != null && thread.isAlive()) {
        thread.interrupt();
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Thread` object as a parameter and checks if it is not null and is still alive. If it is, it calls the `interrupt()` method on the thread to interrupt its execution. 

You can call this method from another thread to interrupt the execution of the specified thread.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread cannot modify this thread for java.lang.Thread.interrupt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the current thread has permission to interrupt the specified thread:

```java
public void interruptInvoke(Thread thread) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkAccess(thread);
    }
    if (thread != null && thread.isAlive()) {
        thread.interrupt();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed in the JVM. If it is, it calls the `checkAccess()` method on the `SecurityManager` to check if the current thread has permission to modify the specified thread. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the current thread has permission, or if there is no `SecurityManager` installed, the method proceeds to check if the specified thread is not null and is still alive. If it is, it calls the `interrupt()` method on the thread to interrupt its execution.
