Please write a java method that Creates and returns a PrinterJob which is initially associated with the default printer.
Sure, here's the Java method that creates and returns a PrinterJob which is initially associated with the default printer:

```java
import java.awt.print.PrinterJob;

public class PrinterJobHelper {
    public static PrinterJob getDefaultPrinterJob() {
        PrinterJob printerJob = PrinterJob.getPrinterJob();
        return printerJob;
    }
}
```

This method uses the `getPrinterJob()` method of the `PrinterJob` class to create a new `PrinterJob` object that is initially associated with the default printer. It then returns this object to the calling code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a security manager exists and its          SecurityManager.checkPrintJobAccess()          method disallows this thread from creating a print job request for java.awt.print.PrinterJob.getPrinterJob() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if a security manager exists and its `SecurityManager.checkPrintJobAccess()` method disallows this thread from creating a print job request for `java.awt.print.PrinterJob.getPrinterJob()`. If the security manager exists and disallows the request, a `SecurityException` is thrown:

```java
import java.awt.print.PrinterJob;

public class PrinterJobHelper {
    public static PrinterJob getDefaultPrinterJob() {
        SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (securityManager != null) {
            securityManager.checkPrintJobAccess();
        }
        PrinterJob printerJob = PrinterJob.getPrinterJob();
        return printerJob;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager exists, it then calls its `checkPrintJobAccess()` method to check if the current thread is allowed to create a print job request for `PrinterJob.getPrinterJob()`. If the security manager disallows the request, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If the security manager allows the request or if no security manager exists, the method proceeds to create and return a `PrinterJob` object that is initially associated with the default printer.
