Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this duration with the specified duration in milliseconds subtracted.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a duration with the specified duration in milliseconds subtracted:

```java
public Duration subtractMillis(Duration duration, long millis) {
    return duration.minusMillis(millis);
}
```

This method takes in two parameters: the `duration` to subtract from and the number of `millis` to subtract. It then uses the `minusMillis()` method of the `Duration` class to subtract the specified number of milliseconds from the duration and return a new copy of the duration with the subtraction applied.

Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.Duration.minusMillis(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for numeric overflow and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it occurs:

```java
public Duration subtractMillis(Duration duration, long millis) {
    try {
        return duration.minusMillis(millis);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while subtracting milliseconds from duration.");
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may be thrown by the `minusMillis()` method if a numeric overflow occurs. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message indicating that a numeric overflow occurred while subtracting milliseconds from the duration.
