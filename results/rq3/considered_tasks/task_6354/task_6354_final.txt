Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for numeric overflow and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it occurs:

```java
public Duration subtractMillis(Duration duration, long millis) {
    try {
        return duration.minusMillis(millis);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while subtracting milliseconds from duration.");
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may be thrown by the `minusMillis()` method if a numeric overflow occurs. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message indicating that a numeric overflow occurred while subtracting milliseconds from the duration.
