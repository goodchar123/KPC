Please write a java method that Inserts the specified element at the end of this deque if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning true upon success and false if no space is currently available.
Here's a Java method that inserts an element at the end of a deque:

```java
public boolean addLast(E element) {
    if (size() == capacity) {
        return false;
    }
    deque[size++] = element;
    return true;
}
```

This method first checks if the deque is already at capacity. If it is, it returns false to indicate that no space is available. Otherwise, it adds the element to the end of the deque and increments the size of the deque. Finally, it returns true to indicate that the element was successfully added.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the element cannot be added at this         time due to capacity restrictions for java.util.Deque.addLast(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if the class of the specified element         prevents it from being added to this deque for java.util.Deque.addLast(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ClassCastException.
Please check if the specified element is null and this         deque does not permit null elements for java.util.Deque.addLast(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if some property of the specified         element prevents it from being added to this deque for java.util.Deque.addLast(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Here's an updated Java method that includes the requested checks and exceptions:

```java
public boolean addLast(E element) {
    if (element == null && !allowsNull) {
        throw new NullPointerException("This deque does not permit null elements");
    }
    if (size() == capacity) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Capacity restrictions prevent adding element to deque");
    }
    if (!element.getClass().isInstance(deque.getClass().getComponentType())) {
        throw new ClassCastException("The class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this deque");
    }
    deque[size++] = element;
    return true;
}
```

This method first checks if the specified element is null and the deque does not permit null elements. If this is the case, it throws a `NullPointerException`. Next, it checks if the deque is already at capacity. If it is, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. Then, it checks if the class of the specified element is compatible with the class of the deque's elements. If it is not, it throws a `ClassCastException`. Finally, if all checks pass, it adds the element to the end of the deque and returns true to indicate success. If any of the checks fail, an appropriate exception is thrown.
