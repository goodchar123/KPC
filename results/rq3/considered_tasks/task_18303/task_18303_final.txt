You're right, it's important to handle those exceptions properly. Here's the updated code snippet with the exception handling:

```
public void deleteMedium(List<Medium> mediaList, String oldMedium) {
    Iterator<Medium> iterator = mediaList.iterator();
    boolean found = false;
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Medium medium = iterator.next();
        if (medium.getName().equals(oldMedium)) {
            iterator.remove();
            found = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (!found) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException();
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first initialize the iterator and a boolean flag to keep track of whether the medium was found or not. Then, we use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop to allow us to break out of the loop early if we find the medium to be deleted. Inside the loop, we check if the current medium matches the one to be deleted, and if so, we call `iterator.remove()` to delete it and set the `found` flag to true. After the loop, we check if the `found` flag is still false, which means the medium was not found, and throw a `NoSuchElementException` in that case.

As for the `UnsupportedOperationException` and `IllegalStateException`, we don't need to handle them explicitly in this case because the `List` interface guarantees that its iterators support the `remove()` method and that calling `remove()` after a call to `next()` is legal.
