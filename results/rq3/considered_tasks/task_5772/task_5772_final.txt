Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for both invalid buffer size values and errors in the underlying protocol:

```java
public void setReceiveBufferSize(DatagramSocket socket, int bufferSize) throws SocketException {
    if (bufferSize <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Buffer size must be greater than 0");
    }
    try {
        socket.setReceiveBufferSize(bufferSize);
    } catch (SocketException e) {
        throw new SocketException("Error setting receive buffer size: " + e.getMessage());
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid buffer size: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the buffer size value is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it throws an IllegalArgumentException with a message indicating that the buffer size must be greater than 0. If the value is valid, it calls the `setReceiveBufferSize` method on the socket object, passing in the buffer size value. 

If there is an error setting the option, a SocketException will be thrown. The catch block for SocketException throws a new SocketException with a message indicating that there was an error setting the receive buffer size. 

If the buffer size value is not valid, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. The catch block for IllegalArgumentException throws a new IllegalArgumentException with a message indicating that the buffer size is invalid.
