Please write a java method that Reads characters into a portion of an array.
Sure, here's an example method that reads characters into a portion of an array:

```java
public static void readChars(char[] arr, int start, int length) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int end = start + length;
    for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
        arr[i] = (char) reader.read();
    }
}
```

This method takes in an array `arr`, a starting index `start`, and a length `length`. It then reads characters from the standard input stream using a `BufferedReader`, and stores them in the array starting at the specified index and continuing for the specified length. Note that this method throws an `IOException`, so you'll need to handle that in your calling code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.Reader.read(char[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error when using `java.io.Reader.read(char[])`:

```java
public static void readChars(char[] arr, int start, int length) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int end = start + length;
    int numRead = 0;
    while (numRead < length) {
        int count = reader.read(arr, start + numRead, length - numRead);
        if (count < 0) {
            throw new IOException("Unexpected end of stream");
        }
        numRead += count;
    }
}
```

This updated method uses the `read(char[])` method of `java.io.Reader` to read characters into the array. It reads characters in a loop until the specified length is reached, checking for an unexpected end of stream after each read. If an I/O error occurs, it will be thrown as an `IOException`.
