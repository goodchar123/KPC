Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if a security manager exists and its `checkPermission` method doesn't allow access to the process environment for `java.lang.ProcessBuilder.environment()`. If the security manager exists and doesn't allow access, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```java
public static Map<String, String> getProcessBuilderEnvironment(ProcessBuilder pb) {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("getenv.*"));
