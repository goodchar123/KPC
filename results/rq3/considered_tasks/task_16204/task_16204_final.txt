You're right, it's important to check if the cipher is in the correct state before calling the `update` method. Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes this check:

```java
public byte[] process(byte[] data) throws IllegalStateException {
    if (cipher == null || !initialized) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cipher not initialized");
    }
    return cipher.update(data);
}
```

In addition to checking if the cipher object is null, we also check if the `initialized` flag is set to true. This flag can be set to true when the cipher is
