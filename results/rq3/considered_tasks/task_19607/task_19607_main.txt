Please write a java method that Returns a List containing all Location objects that map to the given line number.
Sure, here's an example Java method that returns a List of Location objects that map to a given line number:

```java
public List<Location> getLocationsForLine(int lineNumber) {
    List<Location> locations = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Location location : locationList) {
        if (location.getLineNumber() == lineNumber) {
            locations.add(location);
        }
    }
    return locations;
}
```

In this example, `locationList` is assumed to be a List of Location objects. The method loops through each Location object in the list and checks if its line number matches the given `lineNumber`. If it does, the Location object is added to the `locations` list. Finally, the method returns the `locations` list containing all Location objects that map to the given line number.

Please check if the iteration has no more elements for java.util.Iterator.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the iteration has no more elements for `java.util.Iterator.next()` and throws a `NoSuchElementException` if there are no more elements:

```java
public List<Location> getLocationsForLine(int lineNumber) {
    List<Location> locations = new ArrayList<>();
    Iterator<Location> iterator = locationList.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Location location = iterator.next();
        if (location.getLineNumber() == lineNumber) {
            locations.add(location);
        }
    }
    if (locations.isEmpty()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No locations found for line number " + lineNumber);
    }
    return locations;
}
```

In this updated version, we use a `java.util.Iterator` to loop through each Location object in the list. We check if the iterator has more elements using `iterator.hasNext()` and retrieve the next element using `iterator.next()`. If the `locations` list is empty after the loop, we throw a `NoSuchElementException` with a message indicating that no locations were found for the given line number.

I apologize for the confusion. My previous response already included an updated version of the Java method that checks if the iteration has no more elements for `java.util.Iterator.next()` and throws a `NoSuchElementException` if there are no more elements. Here it is again for your reference:

```java
public List<Location> getLocationsForLine(int lineNumber) {
    List<Location> locations = new ArrayList<>();
    Iterator<Location> iterator = locationList.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Location location = iterator.next();
        if (location.getLineNumber() == lineNumber) {
            locations.add(location);
        }
    }
    if (locations.isEmpty()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No locations found for line number " + lineNumber);
    }
    return locations;
}
```

If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.
