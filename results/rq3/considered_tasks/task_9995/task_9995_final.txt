Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for I/O errors when closing the BufferedWriter and throws an IOException if necessary:

```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;

public void writeBufferedFieldsToStream(OutputStream outputStream, String[] fields) throws IOException {
    BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream));
    try {
        for (String field : fields) {
            writer.write(field);
            writer.write(",");
        }
        writer.newLine();
        writer.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // If an I/O error occurs for newLine() or flush(), throw an IOException
        throw new IOException("Error writing buffered fields to stream", e);
    } finally {
        try {
            writer.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // If an I/O error occurs when closing the BufferedWriter, throw an IOException
            throw new IOException("Error closing BufferedWriter", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a nested try-catch block to catch any IOExceptions that may occur when closing the BufferedWriter. If an IOException occurs, the method throws a new IOException with a descriptive error message and the original exception as the cause.

Note that the `finally` block is necessary to ensure that the BufferedWriter is closed even if an exception is thrown during the write operation.
