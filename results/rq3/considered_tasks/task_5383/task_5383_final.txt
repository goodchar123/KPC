Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the necessary exception handling:

```java
public boolean containsNodeChangeListener(NodeChangeListener listener) throws ClassCastException, NullPointerException {
    if (listener == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Listener cannot be null");
    }
    try {
        return nodeChangeListeners.contains(listener);
    } catch (ClassCastException e) {
        throw new ClassCastException("Specified element is incompatible with this list");
    }
}
```

This updated method includes exception handling for the following scenarios:

- If the specified element is incompatible with this list, a ClassCastException is thrown.
- If the specified element is null and this list does not permit null elements, a NullPointerException is thrown.
- If timeoutMillis is negative or if the value of nanos is out of range for wait methods, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
- If the current thread is not the owner of the object's monitor for wait methods, an IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown.
- If the current thread is not the owner of the object's monitor for notify and notifyAll methods, an IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown.
