Yes, that's correct. The `checkAccess()` method is used to determine if the current thread has permission to access the specified thread group. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

In the code snippet I provided, the `enumerate()` method is called on the input `ThreadGroup` object, which means that the current thread is attempting to access the subgroups of that thread group. Before calling `enumerate()`, the `checkAccess()` method is called on the input `ThreadGroup` to ensure that the current thread has permission to access it. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

Here's the relevant code snippet with comments explaining the use of `checkAccess()`:

```
public static void copyActiveSubgroups(ThreadGroup group, ThreadGroup[] dest) {
    // Check if the current thread has permission to access the input thread group
    group.checkAccess();
    
    int numGroups = group.activeGroupCount();
    ThreadGroup[] groups = new ThreadGroup[numGroups];
