Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the mark has been set before calling `reset()`, and throws an `InvalidMarkException` if it hasn't:

```java
public void resetBufferWithMarkCheck(ByteBuffer buffer) throws InvalidMarkException {
    if (!buffer.isMarked()) {
        throw new InvalidMarkException();
    }
    buffer.reset();
}
```

This method takes in a `ByteBuffer` and checks if the mark has been set using the `isMarked()` method. If the mark has not been set, it throws an `InvalidMarkException`. If the mark has been set, it calls `reset()` to reset the position of the buffer to the previously marked position.
