Please write a java method that Creates a new buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of this buffer's content.
Here's a Java method that creates a new buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of the original buffer's content:

```java
public ByteBuffer sharedSubsequence(ByteBuffer original, int start, int end) {
    // Create a new buffer with the same capacity as the original buffer
    ByteBuffer shared = ByteBuffer.allocate(original.capacity());

    // Set the position and limit of the shared buffer to the specified subsequence
    shared.position(start);
    shared.limit(end);

    // Slice the original buffer to create a new buffer that shares the same content as the specified subsequence
    ByteBuffer slice = original.slice();
    slice.position(start);
    slice.limit(end);

    // Put the shared subsequence into the new buffer
    shared.put(slice);

    // Reset the position and limit of the shared buffer
    shared.position(0);
    shared.limit(shared.capacity());

    return shared;
}
```

This method takes in the original buffer, the starting index of the subsequence, and the ending index of the subsequence. It creates a new buffer with the same capacity as the original buffer, sets the position and limit of the new buffer to the specified subsequence, slices the original buffer to create a new buffer that shares the same content as the specified subsequence, puts the shared subsequence into the new buffer, and resets the position and limit of the new buffer before returning it.

Please check If the mark has not been set for java.nio.Buffer.reset() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InvalidMarkException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the mark has been set before calling `reset()`, and throws an `InvalidMarkException` if it hasn't:

```java
public void resetBufferWithMarkCheck(ByteBuffer buffer) throws InvalidMarkException {
    if (!buffer.isMarked()) {
        throw new InvalidMarkException();
    }
    buffer.reset();
}
```

This method takes in a `ByteBuffer` and checks if the mark has been set using the `isMarked()` method. If the mark has not been set, it throws an `InvalidMarkException`. If the mark has been set, it calls `reset()` to reset the position of the buffer to the previously marked position.
