Please write a java method that Forks the given tasks, returning when isDone holds for each task or an (unchecked) exception is encountered, in which case the exception is rethrown.
Here's a possible implementation of the method you described:

```java
public static void forkAndWait(List<Callable<Void>> tasks) throws Exception {
    // Create a thread pool with as many threads as tasks
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(tasks.size());
    
    try {
        // Submit all tasks to the executor
        List<Future<Void>> futures = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Callable<Void> task : tasks) {
            futures.add(executor.submit(task));
        }
        
        // Wait for all tasks to complete or throw an exception
        for (Future<Void> future : futures) {
            try {
                future.get(); // This will block until the task is done or an exception is thrown
            } catch (ExecutionException e) {
                // Rethrow the exception that the task threw
                throw e.getCause();
            }
        }
    } finally {
        // Shutdown the executor to release resources
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

This method takes a list of `Callable<Void>` objects, which represent the tasks to be executed. Each task returns `null` and may throw an exception. The method creates a thread pool with as many threads as tasks, submits all tasks to the executor, and waits for all tasks to complete or throw an exception. If any task throws an exception, the method rethrows that exception. Finally, the method shuts down the executor to release resources.

Please check if nThreads <= 0 for java.util.concurrent.Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if the task cannot be         scheduled for execution for java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService.submit(java.util.concurrent.Callable) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw RejectedExecutionException.
Please check if the task is null for java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService.submit(java.util.concurrent.Callable) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if the computation was cancelled for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw CancellationException.
Please check if the current thread was interrupted while waiting for java.util.concurrent.Future.get() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InterruptedException.
Please check if a security manager exists and         shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate         threads that the caller is not permitted to modify         because it does not hold RuntimePermission("modifyThread"),         or the security manager's checkAccess method         denies access. for java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService.shutdown() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated implementation that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static void forkAndWait(List<Callable<Void>> tasks) throws Exception {
    int nThreads = tasks.size();
    if (nThreads <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number of threads must be positive");
    }
    
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(nThreads);
    
    try {
        List<Future<Void>> futures = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Callable<Void> task : tasks) {
            if (task == null) {
                throw new NullPointerException("Task cannot be null");
            }
            try {
                futures.add(executor.submit(task));
            } catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {
                throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task could not be scheduled for execution", e);
            }
        }
        
        for (Future<Void> future : futures) {
            try {
                future.get();
            } catch (CancellationException e) {
                // The computation was cancelled
                throw e;
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // The current thread was interrupted while waiting
                throw e;
            } catch (ExecutionException e) {
                // Rethrow the exception that the task threw
                throw e.getCause();
            }
        }
    } finally {
        try {
            executor.shutdown();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // A security manager exists and denies access
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation checks for the following conditions:

- If `nThreads` is less than or equal to zero, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- If a task is `null`, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
- If a task cannot be scheduled for execution, a `RejectedExecutionException` is thrown.
- If the computation was cancelled, a `CancellationException` is thrown.
- If the current thread was interrupted while waiting, an `InterruptedException` is thrown.
- If a security manager exists and denies access to shutting down the executor, a `SecurityException` is thrown.
