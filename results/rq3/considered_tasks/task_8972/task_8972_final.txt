Sure, here's an updated implementation that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static void forkAndWait(List<Callable<Void>> tasks) throws Exception {
    int nThreads = tasks.size();
    if (nThreads <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number of threads must be positive");
    }
    
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(nThreads);
    
    try {
        List<Future<Void>> futures = new ArrayList<>(tasks.size());
        for (Callable<Void> task : tasks) {
            if (task == null) {
                throw new NullPointerException("Task cannot be null");
            }
            try {
                futures.add(executor.submit(task));
            } catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {
                throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task could not be scheduled for execution", e);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Task could not be added to the list", e);
            }
        }
        
        for (Future<Void> future : futures) {
            try {
                future.get();
            } catch (CancellationException e) {
                // The computation was cancelled
                throw e;
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // The current thread was interrupted while waiting
                throw e;
            } catch (ExecutionException e) {
                // Rethrow the exception that the task threw
                throw e.getCause();
            }
        }
    } finally {
        try {
            executor.shutdown();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // A security manager exists and denies access
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation checks for the following conditions:

- If `nThreads` is less than or equal to zero, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- If a task is `null`, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
- If the list does not support the `add` operation, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown.
- If the class of the specified element prevents it from being added to the list, a `ClassCastException` is thrown.
- If the specified element is `null` and the list does not permit null elements, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
- If some property of the element prevents it from being added to the list, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- If the computation was cancelled, a `CancellationException` is thrown.
- If the current thread was interrupted while waiting, an `InterruptedException` is thrown.
- If a security manager exists and denies access to shutting down the executor, a `SecurityException` is thrown.
