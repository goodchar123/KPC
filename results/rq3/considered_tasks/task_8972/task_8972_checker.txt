No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught for `java.util.List.add(E)` in the code snippet. However, the code explicitly checks for `null` tasks before adding them to the list, so it is unlikely that a `NullPointerException` would be thrown in this case.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IllegalArgumentException handled or caught for java.util.List.add(E) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IllegalArgumentException` is not handled or caught for `java.util.List.add(E)` in the code snippet.
