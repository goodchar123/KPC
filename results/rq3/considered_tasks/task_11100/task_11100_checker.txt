List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.nio.channels.FileChannel.open(Path path)`
2. `java.nio.channels.FileChannel.tryLock(long position, long size, boolean shared)`
3. `java.nio.channels.FileLock.release()`

 + From response, we get: ['java.nio.channels.FileChannel.open(Pathpath)', 'java.nio.channels.FileChannel.tryLock(longposition,longsize,booleanshared)', 'java.nio.channels.FileLock.release()']

Is the ClosedChannelException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.FileLock.release() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.FileLock.release() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `release()` method is called inside a `finally` block, which ensures that the lock is released even if an exception is thrown. Since `IOException` is a checked exception that can be thrown by the `release()` method, it is handled by the `try-finally` block.

5. `java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException()`

 + From response, we get: ['java.nio.channels.FileChannel.open(Pathpath)', 'java.nio.channels.FileChannel.tryLock(longposition,longsize,booleanshared)', 'java.nio.channels.FileLock.release()', 'java.nio.channels.FileChannel.isOpen()', 'java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException()']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ClosedChannelException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.FileLock.release() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `ClosedChannelException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block that surrounds the `lock.release()` method call.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.FileLock.release() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block that surrounds the `lock.release()` method call.
