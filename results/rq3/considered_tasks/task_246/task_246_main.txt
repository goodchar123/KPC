Please write a java method that Requests that the initiator's credentials be delegated to the acceptor during context establishment.
Here's an example Java method that requests credential delegation during context establishment:

```
public void requestCredentialDelegation(GSSContext context) throws GSSException {
    context.requestCredDeleg(true);
}
```

This method takes a `GSSContext` object as a parameter and calls its `requestCredDeleg` method with a `true` value to request that the initiator's credentials be delegated to the acceptor during context establishment. If the delegation request is successful, the acceptor will be able to use the initiator's credentials to authenticate to other services on behalf of the initiator. If the delegation request fails, a `GSSException` will be thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check containing the following major error codes:   GSSException.FAILURE for org.ietf.jgss.GSSContext.requestCredDeleg(boolean) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw GSSException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the `GSSException.FAILURE` error code when calling `requestCredDeleg` and throws a `GSSException` if necessary:

```
public void requestCredentialDelegation(GSSContext context) throws GSSException {
    try {
        context.requestCredDeleg(true);
    } catch (GSSException e) {
        if (e.getMajor() == GSSException.FAILURE) {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method first tries to call `requestCredDeleg` with a `true` value to request credential delegation. If a `GSSException` is thrown, it checks the exception's major error code using the `getMajor` method. If the major error code is `GSSException.FAILURE`, it re-throws the exception. Otherwise, it continues executing the method. This ensures that any `GSSException` with a major error code of `FAILURE` is properly handled and propagated up the call stack.

Please check if the principal argument is null for javax.security.auth.kerberos.KeyTab.getKeys(javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if a security manager exists and the read access to the keytab file is not permitted for javax.security.auth.kerberos.KeyTab.getKeys(javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for `NullPointerException` and `SecurityException` when calling `KeyTab.getKeys`:

```
public List<Key> getKeytabKeys(KeyTab keytab, String principalName) throws NullPointerException, SecurityException {
    if (principalName == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Principal argument is null");
    }
    try {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            sm.checkPermission(new FilePermission(keytab.getAbsolutePath(), "read"));
        }
        KerberosPrincipal principal = new KerberosPrincipal(principalName);
        return Arrays.asList(keytab.getKeys(principal));
    } catch (NullPointerException | SecurityException e) {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the `principalName` argument is null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. It then checks if a security manager exists and if the read access to the keytab file is not permitted using the `checkPermission` method. If a `SecurityException` is thrown, it is propagated up the call stack. Finally, it creates a `KerberosPrincipal` object from the `principalName` argument and calls `getKeys` on the `KeyTab` object to retrieve the keys associated with the principal. If a `NullPointerException` or `SecurityException` is thrown during this process, it is re-thrown.
