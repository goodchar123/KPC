Please write a java method that Returns the exit value for the process.
Here is a Java method that returns the exit value for a process:

```java
public static int getProcessExitValue(Process process) {
    try {
        return process.waitFor();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        return -1;
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Process` object as input and waits for the process to complete using the `waitFor()` method. The exit value of the process is then returned. If the thread is interrupted while waiting for the process to complete, the method returns -1.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread cannot modify this thread for java.lang.Thread.interrupt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here is the updated Java method that checks if the current thread can modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()` and throws a `SecurityException` if it cannot:

```java
public static int getProcessExitValue(Process process) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkAccess(Thread.currentThread());
    }
    try {
        return process.waitFor();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        return -1;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed and if so, calls its `checkAccess()` method to check if the current thread has permission to modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()`. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If the current thread has permission, the method proceeds to wait for the process to complete and returns its exit value. If the thread is interrupted while waiting for the process to complete, the method returns -1.

    if (security != null) {
        security.checkAccess(Thread.currentThread());
    }
    try {
        return process.waitFor();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        return -1;
    }
