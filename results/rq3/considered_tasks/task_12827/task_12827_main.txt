Please write a java method that Returns the length of the erroneous input described by this object  (optional operation).
I'm assuming you are referring to the `Scanner` class in Java. If so, here's a method that returns the length of the erroneous input described by the `Scanner` object:

```java
public static int getErroneousInputLength(Scanner scanner) {
    int length = 0;
    try {
        scanner.next();
    } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
        length = scanner.match().group().length();
    }
    return length;
}
```

This method takes a `Scanner` object as input and tries to read the next token using the `next()` method. If an `InputMismatchException` is thrown, it means that the input is erroneous. In this case, we can use the `match()` method to get a `MatchResult` object that contains information about the erroneous input. We can then get the length of the erroneous input by calling the `length()` method on the `group()` method of the `MatchResult` object.

Note that this method assumes that the `Scanner` object is using the default delimiter (whitespace). If a custom delimiter is being used, you may need to modify the method accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if no more tokens are available for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check If no match result is available for java.util.Scanner.match() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check If no match has yet been attempted,          or if the previous match operation failed for java.util.regex.MatchResult.group() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static int getErroneousInputLength(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Scanner cannot be null");
    }
    if (!scanner.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No more tokens available");
    }
    if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
    }
    int length = 0;
    try {
        scanner.next();
    } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
        if (scanner.match() == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No match result available");
        }
        String group = scanner.match().group();
        if (group == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No match has yet been attempted");
        }
        length = group.length();
    }
    return length;
}
```

This updated method includes the following checks:

- `if (scanner == null)` checks if the `Scanner` object is null and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is.
- `if (!scanner.hasNext())` checks if there are no more tokens available and throws a `NoSuchElementException` if there are none.
- `if (scanner.ioException() != null)` checks if the `Scanner` object is closed and throws an `IllegalStateException` if it is.
- `if (scanner.match() == null)` checks if there is no match result available and throws an `IllegalStateException` if there isn't.
- `if (group == null)` checks if no match has yet been attempted or if the previous match operation failed and throws an `IllegalStateException` if this is the case.

These checks ensure that the method is robust and can handle various scenarios where the input may be invalid or the `Scanner` object may be in an unexpected state.
