
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for database access errors and unsupported methods:

```java
public Connection getConnection(PooledConnection pooledConnection) throws SQLException {
    Connection connection = null;
    try {
        connection = pooledConnection.getConnection();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Check for database access errors
        throw new SQLException("Error obtaining connection from pooled connection", e);
    }
    if (connection == null) {
        // Check if the JDBC driver does not support this method
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("getConnection() method not supported by JDBC driver");
    }
    // Do any additional setup or configuration on the connection object here
    return connection;
}
```

In this updated version, we first attempt to obtain the connection from the PooledConnection object using the `getConnection()` method. If a SQLException occurs, we catch it and re-throw it with a more descriptive error message.

Next, we check if the connection object is null. If it is, this indicates that the JDBC driver does not support the `getConnection()` method, so we throw a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`.

Finally, if the connection object is not null, we can perform any additional setup or configuration on it before returning it to the caller.
