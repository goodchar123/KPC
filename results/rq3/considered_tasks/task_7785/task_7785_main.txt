Please write a java method that If the class or interface represented by this Class object is a member of another class, returns the Class object representing the class in which it was declared.
Here's the Java method that you requested:

```java
public Class<?> getDeclaringClass(Class<?> clazz) {
    return clazz.getDeclaringClass();
}
```

This method takes a `Class` object as input and returns the `Class` object representing the class in which it was declared. If the input `Class` object is not a member of another class, then `null` is returned.

Please check If a security manager, s, is present and the caller's         class loader is not the same as or an ancestor of the class         loader for the declaring class and invocation of s.checkPackageAccess()         denies access to the package of the declaring class for java.lang.Class.getDeclaringClass() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here's the updated Java method that checks for the security manager and throws a `SecurityException` if access to the package of the declaring class is denied:

```java
public Class<?> getDeclaringClass(Class<?> clazz) throws SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        ClassLoader callerLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
        ClassLoader declaringLoader = clazz.getDeclaringClass().getClassLoader();
        if (declaringLoader != null && !declaringLoader.isAncestorOf(callerLoader)) {
            sm.checkPackageAccess(clazz.getDeclaringClass().getPackage().getName());
        }
    }
    return clazz.getDeclaringClass();
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager is present. If so, it gets the class loader of the caller and the class loader of the declaring class. If the declaring class has a class loader and it is not an ancestor of the caller's class loader, then it calls `s.checkPackageAccess()` to check if access to the package of the declaring class is allowed. If access is denied, a `SecurityException` is thrown. Otherwise, the method returns the `Class` object representing the class in which it was declared.
