
Here's the updated Java method that checks for resource, security, and argument exceptions when obtaining a line from a mixer:

```java
import javax.sound.sampled.*;

public Set<Line> getOpenSourceLines(Mixer mixer) throws LineUnavailableException, IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException {
    Set<Line> openLines = new HashSet<>();
    Line.Info[] lineInfos = mixer.getSourceLineInfo();
    for (Line.Info lineInfo : lineInfos) {
        try {
            Line line = mixer.getLine(lineInfo);
            if (line instanceof SourceDataLine && line.isOpen()) {
                openLines.add(line);
            }
        } catch (LineUnavailableException e) {
            // A matching line is not available due to resource restrictions
            throw e;
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            // A matching line is not available due to security restrictions
            throw e;
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            // This mixer does not support any lines matching the description
            throw e;
        }
    }
    return openLines;
}
```

This updated method now includes try-catch blocks to handle the exceptions that may be thrown when obtaining a line from a mixer. 

If a matching line is not available due to resource restrictions, a `LineUnavailableException` is thrown. If a matching line is not available due to security restrictions, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If this mixer does not support any lines matching the description, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

Note that the `getLine()` method may also throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` if the mixer does not support the requested line. However, this exception is a runtime exception and does not need to be explicitly caught or declared in the method signature.
