Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes all the requested checks:

```java
import javax.smartcardio.*;

public byte[] transmitCommandAPDU(CardChannel channel, byte[] commandAPDU) throws CardException {
    // Check if the channel is closed or the card is disconnected
    if (!channel.isConnected()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Channel is closed or card is disconnected");
    }

    // Check if the APDU is a MANAGE CHANNEL command
    CommandAPDU command = new CommandAPDU(commandAPDU);
    if (command.getINS() == 0x70 && command.getP1() == 0x00 && command.getP2() == 0x00) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("APDU encodes a MANAGE CHANNEL command");
    }

    // Check if the command is null
