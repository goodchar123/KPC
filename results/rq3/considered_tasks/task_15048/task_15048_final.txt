You're right, it's important to check if the key is null before calling the `get` method on the `Dictionary` object. Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes this check and throws a `NullPointerException` if the key is null:

```java
public static Object getValue(Dictionary dict, Object key) {
    if (dict == null) {
        return null;
    }
    if (key == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Key cannot be null");
    }
    return dict.get(key);
}
```

This method first checks if the `Dictionary` object is null, and if so, returns null. Then it checks if the `key` object is null, and if so, throws a `NullPointerException` with a message indicating that the key cannot be null. Otherwise, it calls the `get` method on the `Dictionary` object, passing in the `key` object, and returns the result.
