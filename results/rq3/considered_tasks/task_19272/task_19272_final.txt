Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the requested exception handling:

```java
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.nio.channels.SctpChannel;
import com.sun.nio.sctp.SctpServerChannel;

public class SCTPServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try {
            // Check if SCTP protocol is supported
            if (!SctpServerChannel.isSupported()) {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("SCTP protocol not supported");
            }

            // Create a new SCTP server channel
            SctpServerChannel serverChannel = SctpServerChannel.open();

            // Bind the server channel to a local address and port
            InetSocketAddress address = new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 5000);
            serverChannel.bind(address);

            // Start accepting incoming connections
            while (true) {
                try {
                    SctpChannel clientChannel = serverChannel.accept();

                    // Check if channel is closed
                    if (!serverChannel.isOpen()) {
                        throw new ClosedChannelException();
                    }

                    // Handle the incoming connection
                    // ...
                } catch (AsynchronousCloseException e) {
                    // Another thread closed the channel while accept operation was in progress
                    throw e;
                } catch (ClosedByInterruptException e) {
                    // Another thread interrupted the current thread while accept operation was in progress
                    throw e;
                } catch (NotYetBoundException e) {
                    // Channel's socket has not yet been bound
                    throw e;
                } catch (SecurityException e) {
                    // Security manager does not permit access to remote peer
                    throw e;
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    // Some other I/O error occurred
                    throw e;
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // I/O error occurred while opening server channel
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated code snippet includes exception handling for the various scenarios you mentioned. It checks if the SCTP protocol is supported before opening the server channel, and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it is not. It also checks for I/O errors when opening the server channel and throws an `IOException` if one occurs.

When accepting incoming connections, it checks if the channel is closed and throws a `ClosedChannelException` if it is. It also handles various other exceptions that may occur during the accept operation, such as `AsynchronousCloseException`, `ClosedByInterruptException`, `NotYetBoundException`, `SecurityException`, and `IOException`. If any of these exceptions occur, they are re-thrown to be handled by the calling code.
