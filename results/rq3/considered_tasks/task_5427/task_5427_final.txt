Sure, here's an updated version of the `removeNode()` method that includes the requested checks:

```java
import java.util.prefs.*;

public class PreferencesRemover {
    public static void removeNode(Preferences node) throws BackingStoreException {
        if (node.isRoot()) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Cannot remove root node.");
        }
        try {
            node.removeNode();
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Node or ancestor already removed.", e);
        } catch (BackingStoreException e) {
            throw new BackingStoreException("Failed to remove node.", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method first checks if the node is the root node, and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it is. It then attempts to remove the node using the `removeNode()` method, but catches any `IllegalStateException` or `BackingStoreException` that may be thrown. If an `IllegalStateException` is caught, it means that the node or one of its ancestors has already been removed, so the method throws a new `IllegalStateException` with a more descriptive message and the original exception as its cause. If a `BackingStoreException` is caught, it means that the operation failed due to a failure in the backing store or inability to communicate with it, so the method throws a new `BackingStoreException` with a more descriptive message and the original exception as its cause.
