List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.open()`
2. `java.net.InetSocketAddress.InetSocketAddress(java.lang.String, int)`
3. `java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress)`
4. `java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.close()`

 + From response, we get: ['java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.open()', 'java.net.InetSocketAddress.InetSocketAddress(java.lang.String,int)', 'java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress)', 'java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.close()']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.open() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block surrounding the `SocketChannel.open()` method call.
------------------------------------------------------

No. The `AlreadyConnectedException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack and potentially terminate the program.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ConnectionPendingException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `ConnectionPendingException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack and potentially terminate the program.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ClosedChannelException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `ClosedChannelException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack and potentially terminate the program.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the AsynchronousCloseException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `AsynchronousCloseException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack and potentially terminate the program.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ClosedByInterruptException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `ClosedByInterruptException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack and potentially terminate the program.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the UnresolvedAddressException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `UnresolvedAddressException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack and potentially terminate the program.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the UnsupportedAddressTypeException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `UnsupportedAddressTypeException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack and potentially terminate the program.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the SecurityException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `SecurityException` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack and potentially terminate the program.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.nio.channels.SocketChannel.connect(java.net.SocketAddress) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block surrounding the `SocketChannel.connect()` method call.
