Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this OffsetDateTime with the month-of-year altered.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of an `OffsetDateTime` object with the month-of-year altered:

```java
public static OffsetDateTime withMonth(OffsetDateTime dateTime, int month) {
    return dateTime.withMonth(month);
}
```

This method takes an `OffsetDateTime` object and an integer value representing the desired month-of-year. It then returns a copy of the original `OffsetDateTime` object with the month-of-year altered to the specified value.

You can call this method by passing in an `OffsetDateTime` object and the desired month-of-year value:

```java
OffsetDateTime originalDateTime = OffsetDateTime.now();
OffsetDateTime newDateTime = withMonth(originalDateTime, 6);
```

In this example, the `withMonth` method is called with the current date and time as the original `OffsetDateTime` object and the value `6` as the desired month-of-year. The method returns a new `OffsetDateTime` object with the month-of-year set to June.

Please check if the month of year value is invalid for java.time.OffsetDateTime.withMonth(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the month-of-year value is valid for `OffsetDateTime.withMonth(int)` and throws a `DateTimeException` if it's invalid:

```java
public static OffsetDateTime withMonth(OffsetDateTime dateTime, int month) {
    try {
        return dateTime.withMonth(month);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid month-of-year value: " + month, e);
    }
}
```

This method takes an `OffsetDateTime` object and an integer value representing the desired month-of-year. It then attempts to return a copy of the original `OffsetDateTime` object with the month-of-year altered to the specified value using the `withMonth` method. If the month-of-year value is invalid, a `DateTimeException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the invalid value and the original exception.

You can call this method by passing in an `OffsetDateTime` object and the desired month-of-year value:

```java
OffsetDateTime originalDateTime = OffsetDateTime.now();
OffsetDateTime newDateTime = withMonth(originalDateTime, 13);
```

In this example, the `withMonth` method is called with the current date and time as the original `OffsetDateTime` object and the value `13` as the desired month-of-year. Since `13` is an invalid month-of-year value, a `DateTimeException` is thrown with the error message "Invalid month-of-year value: 13".
