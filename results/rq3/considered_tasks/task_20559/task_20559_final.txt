
Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes error handling for the scenarios you mentioned:

```java
public void writeSQLXMLValue(SQLXML xmlValue, OutputStream outputStream) throws SQLException, IOException {
    if (xmlValue == null) {
        throw new SQLException("SQLXML value is null");
    }
    try {
        InputStream inputStream = xmlValue.getBinaryStream();
        if (inputStream == null) {
            throw new SQLException("SQLXML value is not readable");
        }
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int bytesRead;
        while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            if (outputStream == null) {
                throw new NullPointerException("Output stream is null");
            }
            outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
        }
        inputStream.close();
    } catch (SQLFeatureNotSupportedException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error writing SQLXML value to stream", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following error handling:

- If the SQLXML value is null, a SQLException is thrown with an appropriate message.
- If the SQLXML value is not readable, a SQLException is thrown with an appropriate message.
- If the JDBC driver does not support the getBinaryStream() method, a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException is thrown.
- If the output stream is null, a NullPointerException is thrown.
- If there is an error reading or writing the stream, an IOException is thrown.
- If there is any other type of exception, a SQLException is thrown with an appropriate message and the original exception as the cause.
