Sure, here's an updated version of the `setParameterStream` method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the currently running statement if the timeout has been exceeded:

```java
public void setParameterStream(int parameterIndex, InputStream inputStream, int queryTimeout) throws SQLException {
    PreparedStatement preparedStatement = null;
    try {
        preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement("UPDATE my_table SET my_column = ? WHERE id = ?");
        preparedStatement.setBinaryStream(parameterIndex, inputStream);
        preparedStatement.setInt(parameterIndex + 1, 1234);
        preparedStatement.setQueryTimeout(queryTimeout);
        preparedStatement.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            // Timeout occurred, attempt to cancel the statement
            if (preparedStatement != null) {
                preparedStatement.cancel();
            }
        }
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (preparedStatement != null) {
            preparedStatement.close();
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, a new parameter `queryTimeout` has been added to specify the maximum time in seconds that the driver will wait for the statement to execute. The `setQueryTimeout` method is called to set the query timeout on the prepared statement.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is caught, it means that the timeout value has been exceeded. In this case, the method attempts to cancel the statement by calling the `cancel` method on the prepared statement object. The exception is then re-thrown to the calling method.

In the `finally` block, the prepared statement is closed to ensure that it is always closed, even if an exception occurs.
