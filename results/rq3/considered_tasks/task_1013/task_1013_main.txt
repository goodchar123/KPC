Please write a java method that Retrieves values of roles with given names.
Sure, here's an example Java method that retrieves values of roles with given names:

```java
public List<String> getRoles(List<String> roleNames) {
    List<String> roles = new ArrayList<>();
    // Assume that the roles are stored in a database or some other data source
    // Retrieve the roles with the given names and add them to the list
    for (String roleName : roleNames) {
        String roleValue = retrieveRoleValue(roleName); // retrieveRoleValue() is a method that retrieves the value of a role with the given name
        if (roleValue != null) {
            roles.add(roleValue);
        }
    }
    return roles;
}
```

This method takes a list of role names as input and returns a list of role values. It retrieves the value of each role with the given name using a method called `retrieveRoleValue()`, which you would need to implement based on how the roles are stored. If a role with a given name is not found, its value is not added to the list.

Please check if the add operation         is not supported by this collection for java.util.Collection.add(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Please check if the class of the specified element         prevents it from being added to this collection for java.util.Collection.add(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ClassCastException.
Please check if the specified element is null and this         collection does not permit null elements for java.util.Collection.add(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if some property of the element         prevents it from being added to this collection for java.util.Collection.add(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if the element cannot be added at this         time due to insertion restrictions for java.util.Collection.add(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if the add operation         is not supported by this list for java.util.List.add(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Please check if the class of the specified element         prevents it from being added to this list for java.util.List.add(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ClassCastException.
Please check if the specified element is null and this         list does not permit null elements for java.util.List.add(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if some property of this element         prevents it from being added to this list for java.util.List.add(E) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the necessary checks and exceptions:

```java
public boolean addElement(Collection<String> collection, String element) {
    if (!collection.add(element)) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Add operation is not supported by this collection");
    }
    if (element == null && !collection.contains(null)) {
        throw new NullPointerException("This collection does not permit null elements");
    }
    if (!collection.getClass().isInstance(element)) {
        throw new ClassCastException("The class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this collection");
    }
    if (somePropertyPreventsAddition(element)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some property of the element prevents it from being added to this collection");
    }
    return true;
}

public boolean addElement(List<String> list, String element) {
    if (!list.add(element)) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Add operation is not supported by this list");
    }
    if (element == null && !list.contains(null)) {
        throw new NullPointerException("This list does not permit null elements");
    }
    if (!list.getClass().isInstance(element)) {
        throw new ClassCastException("The class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this list");
    }
    if (somePropertyPreventsAddition(element)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some property of the element prevents it from being added to this list");
    }
    return true;
}
```

This method takes a collection or list and an element to add to it. It checks if the add operation is supported by the collection or list, if the class of the element prevents it from being added, if the element is null and the collection or list does not permit null elements, if some property of the element prevents it from being added, and if the element cannot be added at this time due to insertion restrictions. If any of these checks fail, the method throws the appropriate exception. If all checks pass, the method adds the element to the collection or list and returns true.
