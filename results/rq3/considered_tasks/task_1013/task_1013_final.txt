Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the necessary checks and exceptions:

```java
public boolean addElement(Collection<String> collection, String element) {
    if (!collection.add(element)) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Add operation is not supported by this collection");
    }
    if (element == null && !collection.contains(null)) {
        throw new NullPointerException("This collection does not permit null elements");
    }
    if (!collection.getClass().isInstance(element)) {
        throw new ClassCastException("The class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this collection");
    }
    if (somePropertyPreventsAddition(element)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some property of the element prevents it from being added to this collection");
    }
    return true;
}

public boolean addElement(List<String> list, String element) {
    if (!list.add(element)) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Add operation is not supported by this list");
    }
    if (element == null && !list.contains(null)) {
        throw new NullPointerException("This list does not permit null elements");
    }
    if (!list.getClass().isInstance(element)) {
        throw new ClassCastException("The class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this list");
    }
    if (somePropertyPreventsAddition(element)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some property of the element prevents it from being added to this list");
    }
    return true;
}
```

This method takes a collection or list and an element to add to it. It checks if the add operation is supported by the collection or list, if the class of the element prevents it from being added, if the element is null and the collection or list does not permit null elements, if some property of the element prevents it from being added, and if the element cannot be added at this time due to insertion restrictions. If any of these checks fail, the method throws the appropriate exception. If all checks pass, the method adds the element to the collection or list and returns true.
