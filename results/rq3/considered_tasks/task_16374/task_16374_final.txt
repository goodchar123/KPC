Here's the updated Java method that checks if conditions are supported for `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.isHeldExclusively()` and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if not, and also checks if `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.isHeldExclusively()` returns false for `java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject.hasWaiters()` and throws an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if necessary:

```
public boolean hasWaiters(Condition condition) {
    if (!(condition instanceof AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("not owner");
    }
    if (!isHeldExclusively()) {
        throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
    }
    if (!supportsConditions()) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }
    return ((AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject) condition).hasWaiters();
}
```

This method first checks whether the condition object is an instance of `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject`, as in the previous versions. If it is not, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.

Next, the method checks whether the synchronizer is held exclusively by the current thread by calling the `isHeldExclusively()` method. If this method returns `false`, it means that the current thread does not hold the lock associated with the synchronizer, and an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is thrown.

Then, the method checks whether the synchronizer supports conditions by calling the `supportsConditions()` method. If this method returns `false`, it means that conditions are not supported for this synchronizer, and an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown.

If the synchronizer is held exclusively by the current thread and supports conditions, the method calls the `hasWaiters()` method on the condition object to check whether any threads are waiting on the condition. This method returns `true` if there are any waiting threads, and
