Please write a java method that Causes this piped input stream to be connected to the piped  output stream src.
Here's a Java method that connects a PipedInputStream to a PipedOutputStream:

```
public void connectPipedStreams(PipedInputStream in, PipedOutputStream out) throws IOException {
    in.connect(out);
}
```

This method takes in a PipedInputStream and a PipedOutputStream as parameters and connects them using the `connect()` method of the PipedInputStream class. It throws an IOException if there is an error connecting the streams.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.PipedInputStream.connect(java.io.PipedOutputStream) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error when connecting the PipedInputStream to the PipedOutputStream:

```
public void connectPipedStreams(PipedInputStream in, PipedOutputStream out) throws IOException {
    if (!in.isConnected() && !out.isConnected()) {
        try {
            in.connect(out);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error connecting PipedInputStream to PipedOutputStream", e);
        }
    } else {
        throw new IOException("PipedInputStream or PipedOutputStream is already connected");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if both the PipedInputStream and PipedOutputStream are not already connected. If they are not connected, it tries to connect them using the `connect()` method of the PipedInputStream class. If an I/O error occurs during the connection, it throws an IOException with a message indicating the error.

If either the PipedInputStream or PipedOutputStream is already connected, it throws an IOException with a message indicating that one of the streams is already connected.
