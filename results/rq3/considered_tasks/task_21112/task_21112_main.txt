Please write a java method that Retrieves the contents of the SQL ARRAY value designated by this Array object.
Here's an example Java method that retrieves the contents of an SQL ARRAY value designated by an Array object:

```java
public static List<String> getArrayContents(Array array) throws SQLException {
    List<String> contents = new ArrayList<>();
    ResultSet rs = array.getResultSet();
    while (rs.next()) {
        contents.add(rs.getString(2)); // assuming the array contains strings
    }
    return contents;
}
```

This method takes an Array object as input and returns a List of strings representing the contents of the SQL ARRAY value. It uses the `getResultSet()` method of the Array object to obtain a ResultSet containing the array elements, and then iterates over the ResultSet to extract the values and add them to the List. Note that this method assumes that the array contains strings; if the array contains a different data type, you would need to modify the code accordingly. Also, this method throws a SQLException if there is an error retrieving the array contents, so you would need to handle that exception appropriately in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an error occurs while attempting to access the array for java.sql.Array.getResultSet() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.Array.getResultSet() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is         called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the columnIndex is not valid; if a database access error occurs or this method is            called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.getString(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the error handling you requested:

```java
public static List<String> getArrayContents(Array array) throws SQLException {
    List<String> contents = new ArrayList<>();
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        rs = array.getResultSet();
        while (rs.next()) {
            contents.add(rs.getString(2)); // assuming the array contains strings
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (rs != null) {
            rs.close();
        }
        throw e;
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        if (rs != null) {
            rs.close();
        }
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException(e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        if (rs != null) {
            rs.close();
        }
    }
    return contents;
}
```

This updated method includes try-catch blocks to handle the various exceptions that can occur when accessing the array and iterating over the ResultSet. Specifically:

- If an SQLException occurs while calling `getResultSet()`, the method closes the ResultSet (if it was opened) and re-throws the exception.
- If an UnsupportedOperationException occurs while calling `getResultSet()`, the method closes the ResultSet (if it was opened) and throws a new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException with the original exception's message.
- If an SQLException occurs while iterating over the ResultSet (i.e. calling `next()` or `getString()`), the method closes the ResultSet (if it was opened) and re-throws the exception.

Note that the ResultSet is closed in all cases, whether an exception occurs or not, to ensure proper resource management.
