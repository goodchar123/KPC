
The code snippet I provided does not use the `System.arraycopy` method, so there is no need to check for those exceptions. However, if you are using `System.arraycopy` in your code, here are the checks you should perform:

1. To check for access of data outside array bounds, you should ensure that the sum of the `srcPos` and `length` parameters does not exceed the length of the `src` array, and that the sum of the `destPos` and `length` parameters does not exceed the length of the `dest` array. If either of these conditions is not met, you should throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. To check for a type mismatch, you should ensure that the type of each element in the `src` array is compatible with the type of the corresponding element in the `dest` array. If there is a type mismatch, you should throw an `ArrayStoreException`.

3. To check for null arrays, you should ensure that both the `src` and `dest` arrays are not null. If either of them is null, you should throw a `NullPointerException`.
