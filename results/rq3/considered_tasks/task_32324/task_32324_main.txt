Please write a java method that used by readObject to deserialize a collection.
Here is an example Java method that can be used by `readObject` to deserialize a collection:

```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    // Read the default serialization data
    in.defaultReadObject();

    // Read the size of the collection
    int size = in.readInt();

    // Create a new collection to store the deserialized objects
    Collection<Object> collection = new ArrayList<>();

    // Deserialize each object and add it to the collection
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        Object obj = in.readObject();
        collection.add(obj);
    }

    // Set the collection field to the deserialized collection
    this.collection = collection;
}
```

This method assumes that the collection being deserialized is stored in a field called `collection`. The method first reads the default serialization data using `in.defaultReadObject()`. It then reads the size of the collection using `in.readInt()`. Next, it creates a new `ArrayList` to store the deserialized objects. Finally, it loops through each object in the collection, deserializes it using `in.readObject()`, and adds it to the new collection. The method then sets the `collection` field to the deserialized collection.

Please check if the stream is not currently reading          objects. for java.io.ObjectInputStream.defaultReadObject() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NotActiveException.
Please check If end of file is reached. for java.io.ObjectInputStream.readInt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw EOFException.
You are correct, it is important to check for these exceptions when using `defaultReadObject()` and `readInt()` in the `readObject()` method. Here is an updated version of the code snippet that includes these checks:

```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    // Check if stream is currently reading objects
    if (in.readObject() != null) {
        throw new NotActiveException("Stream is currently reading objects");
    }

    // Read the default serialization data
    in.defaultReadObject();

    // Check if end of file is reached
    if (in.readInt() == -1) {
        throw new EOFException("End of file reached");
    }

    // Read the size of the collection
    int size = in.readInt();

    // Create a new collection to store the deserialized objects
    Collection<Object> collection = new ArrayList<>();

    // Deserialize each object and add it to the collection
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        Object obj = in.readObject();
        collection.add(obj);
    }

    // Set the collection field to the deserialized collection
    this.collection = collection;
}
```

The updated code first checks if the stream is currently reading objects by calling `in.readObject()` and checking if the result is not null. If the stream is currently reading objects, a `NotActiveException` is thrown.

Next, the code checks if the end of the file is reached by calling `in.readInt()` and checking if the result is -1. If the end of the file is reached, an `EOFException` is thrown.

Finally, the code proceeds with reading the size of the collection and deserializing each object as before.
