
You are correct, it is important to check for these exceptions when using `defaultReadObject()` and `readInt()` in the `readObject()` method. Here is an updated version of the code snippet that includes these checks:

```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    // Check if stream is currently reading objects
    if (in.readObject() != null) {
        throw new NotActiveException("Stream is currently reading objects");
    }

    // Read the default serialization data
    in.defaultReadObject();

    // Check if end of file is reached
    if (in.readInt() == -1) {
        throw new EOFException("End of file reached");
    }

    // Read the size of the collection
    int size = in.readInt();

    // Create a new collection to store the deserialized objects
    Collection<Object> collection = new ArrayList<>();

    // Deserialize each object and add it to the collection
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        Object obj = in.readObject();
        collection.add(obj);
    }

    // Set the collection field to the deserialized collection
    this.collection = collection;
}
```

The updated code first checks if the stream is currently reading objects by calling `in.readObject()` and checking if the result is not null. If the stream is currently reading objects, a `NotActiveException` is thrown.

Next, the code checks if the end of the file is reached by calling `in.readInt()` and checking if the result is -1. If the end of the file is reached, an `EOFException` is thrown.

Finally, the code proceeds with reading the size of the collection and deserializing each object as before.
