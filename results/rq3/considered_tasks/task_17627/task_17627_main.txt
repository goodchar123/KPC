Please write a java method that Negotiates a TLS session using the default SSL socket factory.
Here's an example Java method that negotiates a TLS session using the default SSL socket factory:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.Socket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;

public class TLSSessionNegotiator {
    
    public static void negotiateTLSSession(String host, int port) throws IOException {
        SSLSocketFactory factory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
        Socket socket = factory.createSocket(host, port);
        SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) socket;
        sslSocket.startHandshake();
    }
}
```

This method takes in a host and port as parameters and uses the default SSL socket factory to create a socket and negotiate a TLS session with the server at the specified host and port. The `startHandshake()` method is called on the `SSLSocket` to initiate the TLS handshake process. If the handshake is successful, a secure TLS session will be established between the client and server.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check on a network level error for javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket.startHandshake() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `negotiateTLSSession` method that checks for network-level errors during the TLS handshake and throws an `IOException` if any occur:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.Socket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;

public class TLSSessionNegotiator {
    
    public static void negotiateTLSSession(String host, int port) throws IOException {
        SSLSocketFactory factory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
        Socket socket = factory.createSocket(host, port);
        SSLSocket sslSocket = (SSLSocket) socket;
        try {
            sslSocket.startHandshake();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            sslSocket.close();
            throw new IOException("TLS handshake failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        if (!sslSocket.isConnected()) {
            throw new IOException("TLS handshake failed: socket is not connected");
        }
        if (!sslSocket.getSession().isValid()) {
            throw new IOException("TLS handshake failed: session is not valid");
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method wraps the `startHandshake()` call in a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur during the handshake. If an exception is caught, the `SSLSocket` is closed and an `IOException` is thrown with a message indicating that the handshake failed.

After the handshake, the method checks if the socket is still connected and if the TLS session is valid. If either of these checks fail, an `IOException` is thrown with an appropriate error message.
