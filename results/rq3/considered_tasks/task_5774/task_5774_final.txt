Sure, here's an updated version of the `setReuseAddr` method that checks for errors and throws a `SocketException` if necessary:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class SocketOptionExample {
    public static void setReuseAddr(Socket socket, boolean enable) throws SocketException {
        try {
            socket.setReuseAddress(enable);
        } catch (SocketException e) {
            throw new SocketException("Error setting SO_REUSEADDR option: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new SocketException("Socket is closed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we've added a try-catch block to catch any `SocketException` or `IllegalStateException` that might be thrown when setting the SO_REUSEADDR option. If an exception is caught, we throw a new `SocketException` with a descriptive error message.

This way, if an error occurs or the socket is closed, the method will throw a `SocketException` with a clear message indicating what went wrong.
