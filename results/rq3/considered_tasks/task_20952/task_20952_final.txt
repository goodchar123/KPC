
Here's the updated Java method that includes error handling for the `getTypeInfo()`, `next()`, and `getString()` methods:

```java
public boolean supportsAlterTableWithDropColumn(DatabaseMetaData metadata) throws SQLException {
    boolean supportsAlterTableWithDropColumn = false;
    ResultSet resultSet = null;
    try {
        resultSet = metadata.getTypeInfo();
        while (resultSet.next()) {
            String typeName = resultSet.getString("TYPE_NAME");
            if (typeName.equalsIgnoreCase("ALTER TABLE WITH DROP COLUMN")) {
                supportsAlterTableWithDropColumn = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving type info from database metadata", e);
    } finally {
        if (resultSet != null) {
            try {
                resultSet.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw new SQLException("Error closing result set", e);
            }
        }
    }
    return supportsAlterTableWithDropColumn;
}
```

This updated method includes a try-catch block around the `getTypeInfo()` method call to handle any `SQLException` that may occur. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `SQLException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause.

The method also includes a finally block to ensure that the `ResultSet` is closed properly, even if an exception is thrown. The `next()` and `getString()` methods are also wrapped in try-catch blocks to handle any `SQLException` that may occur. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `SQLException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause.
