Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes error checking and exception handling:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannelGroup;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class AsyncChannelGroupExample {
    
    public static AsynchronousChannelGroup createChannelGroup(ExecutorService threadPool) throws IOException {
        try {
            return AsynchronousChannelGroup.withThreadPool(threadPool);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new IOException("Error creating channel group", e);
        }
    }
    
    public static ExecutorService createThreadPool(int nThreads) throws IllegalArgumentException {
        if (nThreads <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Number of threads must be greater than 0");
        }
        return Executors.newFixedThreadPool(nThreads);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService threadPool = null;
        try {
            threadPool = createThreadPool(10);
            AsynchronousChannelGroup channelGroup = createChannelGroup(threadPool);
            // Use the channel group for asynchronous I/O operations
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException | IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            if (threadPool != null) {
                threadPool.shutdown();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, the `createChannelGroup` method now catches any `IOException` that may be thrown by the `withThreadPool` method and re-throws it. If any other exception is thrown, it is wrapped in an `IOException` and thrown instead.

The `createThreadPool` method now checks if the `nThreads` parameter is less than or equal to 0, and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. 

In the `main` method, both `createThreadPool` and `createChannelGroup` are called within a try-catch block that handles any exceptions thrown by these methods. If an exception is caught, it is printed to the console. Finally, the thread pool is shut down in a `finally` block to ensure that it is properly cleaned up.
