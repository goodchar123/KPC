Please write a java method that Registers the given driver with the DriverManager.
Sure, here's an example Java method that registers a driver with the DriverManager:

```java
public void registerDriver(String driverClassName) throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {
    Class.forName(driverClassName);
    DriverManager.registerDriver(new Driver());
}
```

This method takes a `String` parameter `driverClassName` which is the fully qualified name of the driver class. It first loads the driver class using `Class.forName()` method and then registers the driver with the `DriverManager` using `DriverManager.registerDriver()` method.

Note that this method throws `ClassNotFoundException` and `SQLException` which should be handled appropriately.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the linkage fails for java.lang.Class.forName(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw LinkageError.
Please check if the initialization provoked            by this method fails for java.lang.Class.forName(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ExceptionInInitializerError.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for `LinkageError` and `ExceptionInInitializerError`:

```java
public void registerDriver(String driverClassName) throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {
    try {
        Class.forName(driverClassName);
    } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
        throw new LinkageError("Class not found: " + driverClassName);
    } catch (ExceptionInInitializerError e) {
        throw new ExceptionInInitializerError("Initialization failed for class: " + driverClassName);
    }
    DriverManager.registerDriver(new Driver());
}
```

This updated method first tries to load the driver class using `Class.forName()` method and catches `ClassNotFoundException` and `ExceptionInInitializerError` exceptions. If the linkage fails, it throws a `LinkageError` with an appropriate message. If the initialization fails, it throws an `ExceptionInInitializerError` with an appropriate message.

After checking for errors, the method registers the driver with the `DriverManager` using `DriverManager.registerDriver()` method. Note that this method still throws `SQLException` which should be handled appropriately.
