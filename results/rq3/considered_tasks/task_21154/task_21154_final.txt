
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the input stream reaches the end before reading four bytes and also checks for any I/O errors:

```java
public float readNextAttributeAsFloat(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    DataInputStream dataInputStream = new DataInputStream(inputStream);
    if (dataInputStream.available() < 4) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    try {
        return dataInputStream.readFloat();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        if (e.getMessage().equals("Stream closed")) {
            throw new IOException("The stream has been closed and the contained input stream does not support reading after close", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the number of bytes available in the input stream is less than 4 (the size of a float). If it is, an `EOFException` is thrown. Otherwise, it tries to read the next four bytes from the input stream as a float using `DataInputStream.readFloat()`. If an `IOException` occurs, it checks if the error message is "Stream closed". If it is, it throws a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. Otherwise, it rethrows the original `IOException`.
