Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for both cases you mentioned:

```java
public LocalTime subtractTime(LocalTime time, Duration duration) {
    try {
        return time.minus(duration);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Subtraction cannot be made", e);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred during subtraction");
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch both `DateTimeException` and `ArithmeticException` that may occur during the subtraction operation.

If a `DateTimeException` is caught, the method throws a new `DateTimeException` with a custom message indicating that the subtraction cannot be made. The original exception is passed as a parameter to the new exception.

If an `ArithmeticException` is caught, the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom message indicating that a numeric overflow occurred during the subtraction.

This updated method provides better error handling and helps prevent unexpected errors from occurring during the subtraction operation.
