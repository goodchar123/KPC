Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for all the mentioned exceptions:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FilePath {
    public static String getRealPath(String filePath) throws SecurityException, IOException {
        SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (security != null) {
            security.checkRead(filePath);
        }
        File file = new File(filePath);
        if (file.exists()) {
            try {
                String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();
                if (security != null) {
                    security.checkRead(canonicalPath);
                }
                return canonicalPath;
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw e;
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new IOException("Failed to get canonical path", e);
            }
        } else {
            throw new SecurityException("Access denied to file or directory");
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager exists, it calls its `checkRead()` method to check if read access is allowed for the file or directory. If read access is denied, it throws a `SecurityException`. If the file exists, it gets the canonical path of the file using the `getCanonicalPath()` method. If an `IOException` occurs, it throws the exception. If any other exception occurs, it throws a new `IOException` with the original exception as the cause.

After getting the canonical path, it checks if a security manager exists and calls its `checkRead()` method to check if read access is allowed for the canonical path. If read access is denied, it throws a `SecurityException`. If read access is allowed, it returns the canonical path. If the file does not exist, it throws a `SecurityException`.
