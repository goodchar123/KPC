Please write a java method that Acquires in shared mode, aborting if interrupted.
Here's an example Java method that acquires a lock in shared mode and aborts if interrupted:

```
public void acquireSharedLock() throws InterruptedException {
    ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    lock.readLock().lockInterruptibly();
    try {
        // Code to execute while holding the shared lock
    } finally {
        lock.readLock().unlock();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object and acquire the read lock in shared mode using the `lockInterruptibly()` method. This method will block until the lock is available, but will throw an `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock.

We then execute our code while holding the shared lock, and release the lock in a `finally` block to ensure that it is always released, even if an exception is thrown.

Note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread is interrupted for java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.lockInterruptibly() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InterruptedException.
Please check if the current thread does not hold this lock for java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.unlock() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
You are correct, thank you for pointing that out. Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the checks you mentioned:

```
public void acquireSharedLock() throws InterruptedException {
    ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    lock.readLock().lockInterruptibly();
    try {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException();
        }
        // Code to execute while holding the shared lock
    } finally {
        if (!lock.readLock().isHeldByCurrentThread()) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Current thread does not hold this lock");
        }
        lock.readLock().unlock();
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if the current thread has been interrupted using `Thread.interrupted()`. If it has, we throw an `InterruptedException`.

We also check if the current thread holds the lock before unlocking it using `lock.readLock().isHeldByCurrentThread()`. If it doesn't, we throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

These checks ensure that the method behaves correctly and throws the appropriate exceptions if necessary.
