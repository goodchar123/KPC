You are correct, thank you for pointing that out. Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the checks you mentioned:

```
public void acquireSharedLock() throws InterruptedException {
    ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    lock.readLock().lockInterruptibly();
    try {
        if (Thread.interrupted()) {
            throw new InterruptedException();
        }
        // Code to execute while holding the shared lock
    } finally {
        if (!lock.readLock().isHeldByCurrentThread()) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Current thread does not hold this lock");
        }
        lock.readLock().unlock();
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if the current thread has been interrupted using `Thread.interrupted()`. If it has, we throw an `InterruptedException`.

We also check if the current thread holds the lock before unlocking it using `lock.readLock().isHeldByCurrentThread()`. If it doesn't, we throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

These checks ensure that the method behaves correctly and throws the appropriate exceptions if necessary.
