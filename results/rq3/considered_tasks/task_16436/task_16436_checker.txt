List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock`
2. `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.lockInterruptibly()`
3. `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.unlock()`

 + From response, we get: ['java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock', 'java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.lockInterruptibly()', 'java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.unlock()']

Is the InterruptedException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.lockInterruptibly() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `InterruptedException` is declared to be thrown by the `lockInterruptibly()` method, but it is not caught or handled within the method itself. Instead, it is declared to be thrown by the method signature, which means that any code calling this method must either catch the exception or declare that it throws the exception as well.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IllegalMonitorStateException handled or caught for java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.unlock() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IllegalMonitorStateException` is not caught or handled within the method itself. If the `unlock()` method is called without first acquiring the lock, it will throw this exception. It is up to the calling code to ensure that the lock is properly acquired before calling `unlock()`.
