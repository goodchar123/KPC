Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks if the reference to the RMI registry could not be created and throws a `RemoteException` in that case:

```
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;

public class ClientConnection {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws RemoteException {
        try {
            // Create a new instance of the client object
            ClientImpl client = new ClientImpl();
            
            // Export the client object as an RMI object using JRMP
            Client stub = (Client) UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(client, 0);
            
            // Register the RMI object with the RMI registry
            Registry registry = null;
            try {
                registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry();
            } catch (RemoteException e) {
                throw new RemoteException("Could not obtain reference to RMI registry", e);
            }
            registry.rebind("Client", stub);
            
            System.out.println("Client connection created and registered with RMI registry.");
        } catch (RemoteException e) {
            System.err.println("Error creating client connection: " + e.getMessage());
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated code snippet, we first declare a `Registry` variable and initialize it to `null`. We then use a `try-catch` block to attempt to obtain a reference to the RMI registry using the `LocateRegistry.getRegistry()` method. If this method call throws a `RemoteException`, we catch it and throw a new `RemoteException` with a more informative error message.

After obtaining a reference to the RMI registry (or throwing an exception if we couldn't), we proceed with exporting the `ClientImpl` object as an RMI object and registering it with the registry as before.

If an exception occurs during any of these steps, we catch it, print an error message to the console, and re-throw the exception so that the calling code can handle it appropriately.
