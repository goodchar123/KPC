The code snippet I provided does not use `System.arraycopy`, so those checks are not necessary. However, if you were to use `System.arraycopy` in your code, here are the checks you should include:

1. To check if copying would cause access of data outside array bounds, you should ensure that the sum of the `srcPos` and `length` parameters does not exceed the length of the `src` array, and that the sum of the `destPos` and `length` parameters does not exceed the length of the `dest` array. If either of these conditions is not met, you should throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. To check if an element in the `src` array could not be stored into the `dest` array because of a type mismatch, you should ensure that the type of the `src` array is compatible with the type of the `dest` array. If the types are not compatible, you should throw an `ArrayStoreException`.

3. To check if either `src` or `dest` is null, you should ensure that both `src` and `dest` are not null before calling `System.arraycopy`. If either `src` or `dest` is null, you should throw a `NullPointerException`.

Here's an example of how you could modify the code to include these checks:

```
public static void copyShortArrays(short[] src, int srcPos, short[] dest, int destPos, int length) {
    if (src == null || dest == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException();
    }
    if (srcPos < 0 || destPos < 0 || length < 0 || srcPos + length > src.length || destPos + length > dest.length) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    try {
        System.arraycopy(src, srcPos, dest, destPos, length);
    } catch (ArrayStoreException e) {
        // handle ArrayStoreException
    }
}
```

This method takes in two short arrays `src` and `dest`, the starting index of the `src` and `dest` arrays (`srcPos` and `destPos`), and the length of the range to copy (`length`). It first checks if either `src` or `dest` is null, and throws a `NullPointerException` if either is null. It then checks if the parameters are within the bounds of the arrays, and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of the parameters are out of bounds. Finally, it calls `System.arraycopy` and catches any `ArrayStoreException` that may be thrown.
