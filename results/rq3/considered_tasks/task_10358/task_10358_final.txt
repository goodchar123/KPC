Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public static void readChars(char[] arr, int start, int length) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    int end = start + length;
    int numRead = 0;
    while (numRead < length) {
        int count = reader.read(arr, start + numRead, length - numRead);
        if (count < 0) {
            throw new IOException("Unexpected end of stream");
        }
        numRead += count;
    }
}
```

This method uses the `read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)` method of `Reader` to read characters into the array. It reads up to `length` characters, starting at index `start`, and continues reading until `length` characters have been read or the end of the stream is reached. If the end of the stream is reached before `length` characters have been read, an `IOException` is thrown.
