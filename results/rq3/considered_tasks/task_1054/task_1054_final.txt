Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the exception handling you requested:

```java
public void removeTimerNotifications(List<Notification> notifications, String type) {
    Iterator<Notification> iterator = notifications.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Notification notification = iterator.next();
        if (notification.getType().equals(type) && notification instanceof TimerNotification) {
            try {
                iterator.remove();
            } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
                System.err.println("Remove operation not supported by this iterator");
            } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
                System.err.println("Next method has not been called, or remove method has already been called after the last call to the next method");
            }
        }
    }
    if (!notifications.isEmpty() && !iterator.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("Iteration has no more elements");
    }
}
```

This updated method includes a check at the end to throw a `NoSuchElementException` if the iteration has no more elements. Note that we're checking if the `notifications` list is not empty before checking if the iterator has no more elements, since an empty list will always have no more elements in the iterator.

Note that this method still assumes that `Notification` objects have a `getType()` method that returns a `String` representing the type of the notification, and that `TimerNotification` is a subclass of `Notification`. You may need to modify the method to fit your specific use case.
