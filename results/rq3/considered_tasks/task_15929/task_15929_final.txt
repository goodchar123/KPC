Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error when calling `BufferedWriter.newLine()` and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWritingExample {
    public static void writeToFile(String fileName, String[] lines) throws IOException {
        BufferedWriter writer = null;
        try {
            writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(fileName));
            for (String line : lines) {
                writer.write(line);
                writer.newLine();
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing to file: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            if (writer != null) {
                try {
                    writer.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    System.err.println("Error closing writer: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method now throws an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs when calling `BufferedWriter.newLine()`. It also uses a `finally` block to ensure that the writer is closed even if an exception is thrown. The `IOException` thrown by the `BufferedWriter` is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.
