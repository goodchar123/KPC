Please write a java method that Sets this RowSet object's command property to the given String object and clears the parameters, if any, that were set for the previous command.
Here's a Java method that sets the command property of a RowSet object to a given String and clears any previously set parameters:

```java
public void setRowSetCommand(RowSet rowSet, String command) throws SQLException {
    rowSet.setCommand(command);
    rowSet.clearParameters();
}
```

This method takes in a RowSet object and a String command as parameters. It sets the command property of the RowSet object to the given command using the `setCommand()` method. It then clears any previously set parameters using the `clearParameters()` method.

Note that this method throws a SQLException, so you'll need to handle that appropriately in your code.

Please check if a database access error occurs for javax.sql.RowSet.setCommand(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs for javax.sql.RowSet.clearParameters() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for database access errors and throws a SQLException if necessary:

```java
public void setRowSetCommand(RowSet rowSet, String command) throws SQLException {
    try {
        rowSet.setCommand(command);
        rowSet.clearParameters();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Check if a database access error occurred
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("A database access error occurred", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any SQLException that may occur when calling the `setCommand()` and `clearParameters()` methods. It then checks if the error code of the SQLException is 0, which indicates a database access error. If a database access error occurred, it throws a new SQLException with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause. Otherwise, it re-throws the original exception.

Note that this method still throws a SQLException, so you'll need to handle that appropriately in your code.
