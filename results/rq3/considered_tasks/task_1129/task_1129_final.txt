The updated code snippet I provided earlier already checks for `IllegalArgumentException` and wraps it in a `RuntimeOperationsException`. Here's the relevant part of the code:

```java
} catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
    throw new RuntimeOperationsException(e);
}
```

This code catches `IllegalArgumentException` and creates a new `RuntimeOperationsException` with the original exception as its cause. This ensures that the exception is propagated up the call stack with a more informative message.
