Please write a java method that Implements timed condition wait.
Here's an example Java method that implements timed condition wait using the `wait()` and `notifyAll()` methods:

```
public synchronized void timedWait(long timeout) throws InterruptedException {
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long elapsedTime = 0;
    long remainingTime = timeout;

    while (remainingTime > 0) {
        wait(remainingTime);
        elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        remainingTime = timeout - elapsedTime;
    }
}
```

This method takes a `timeout` parameter, which specifies the maximum amount of time to wait in milliseconds. The method uses a `while` loop to repeatedly call the `wait()` method, subtracting the elapsed time from the remaining time until the timeout is reached. If the timeout is reached before the condition is met, the method simply returns. If the condition is met before the timeout, the method can be notified using the `notifyAll()` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if timeoutMillis is negative for java.lang.Object.wait(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if the current thread is not         the owner of the object's monitor for java.lang.Object.wait(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
You are correct, it is important to check for negative timeout values and monitor ownership before calling `wait()` in Java. Here's an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```
public synchronized void timedWait(long timeoutMillis) throws InterruptedException {
    if (timeoutMillis < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Timeout value cannot be negative");
    }

    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long elapsedTime = 0;
    long remainingTime = timeoutMillis;

    while (remainingTime > 0) {
        wait(remainingTime);
        elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        remainingTime = timeoutMillis - elapsedTime;
    }
}

```

In this updated version, we first check if the `timeoutMillis` parameter is negative, and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. We also use the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that the current thread is the owner of the object's monitor before calling `wait()`. If the current thread is not the monitor owner, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` will be thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread is not               the owner of this object's monitor. for java.lang.Object.notify() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
Please check if the current thread is not               the owner of this object's monitor. for java.lang.Object.notifyAll() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
You are correct again, it is important to check if the current thread is the owner of the object's monitor before calling `notify()` or `notifyAll()` in Java. Here's an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```
public synchronized void timedWait(long timeoutMillis) throws InterruptedException {
    if (timeoutMillis < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Timeout value cannot be negative");
    }

    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long elapsedTime = 0;
    long remainingTime = timeoutMillis;

    while (remainingTime > 0) {
        wait(remainingTime);
        elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        remainingTime = timeoutMillis - elapsedTime;
    }
}

public synchronized void notifyAndWait() throws InterruptedException {
    notify();
    wait();
}

public synchronized void notifyAllAndWait() throws InterruptedException {
    notifyAll();
    wait();
}

```

In this updated version, we use the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that the current thread is the owner of the object's monitor before calling `notify()` or `notifyAll()`. If the current thread is not the monitor owner, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` will be thrown.
