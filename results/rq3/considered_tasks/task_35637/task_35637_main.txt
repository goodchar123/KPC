Please write a java method that Returns the focused Window, even if the calling thread is in a different context than the focused Window.
Here's a Java method that returns the focused window, even if the calling thread is in a different context than the focused window:

```java
import java.awt.AWTException;
import java.awt.EventQueue;
import java.awt.Robot;
import java.awt.Window;

public class FocusedWindowHelper {
    public static Window getFocusedWindow() {
        Window focusedWindow = null;
        try {
            Robot robot = new Robot();
            EventQueue.invokeLater(() -> {
                focusedWindow = Window.getFocusedWindow();
            });
            robot.waitForIdle();
        } catch (AWTException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return focusedWindow;
    }
}
```

This method uses the `Robot` class to temporarily switch to the event dispatch thread and retrieve the focused window using the `Window.getFocusedWindow()` method. The `Robot.waitForIdle()` method is used to wait for the event dispatch thread to finish processing events before returning the focused window.

Please check if called on the AWT event dispatching thread for java.awt.Robot.waitForIdle() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalThreadStateException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks if the method is called on the AWT event dispatching thread before calling `Robot.waitForIdle()`. If it's not called on the AWT event dispatching thread, it throws an `IllegalThreadStateException`:

```java
import java.awt.AWTException;
import java.awt.EventQueue;
import java.awt.Robot;
import java.awt.Window;

public class FocusedWindowHelper {
    public static Window getFocusedWindow() {
        Window focusedWindow = null;
        try {
            Robot robot = new Robot();
            EventQueue.invokeLater(() -> {
                focusedWindow = Window.getFocusedWindow();
            });
            if (EventQueue.isDispatchThread()) {
                robot.waitForIdle();
            } else {
                throw new IllegalThreadStateException("Method called on non-EDT thread");
            }
        } catch (AWTException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return focusedWindow;
    }
}
```

Now, if the method is called on a non-EDT thread, it will throw an `IllegalThreadStateException`.
