
The code snippet I provided does not use `System.arraycopy`, so there is no need to check for those exceptions. However, if you are using `System.arraycopy` in your code, here are the checks you should perform:

1. To check for access of data outside array bounds, you should ensure that the source and destination arrays have enough space to hold the specified number of elements. If not, you should throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. To check for a type mismatch, you should ensure that the source and destination arrays have the same element type. If not, you should throw an `ArrayStoreException`.

3. To check for null arrays, you should ensure that both the source and destination arrays are not null. If either one is null, you should throw a `NullPointerException`.

Here's an example of how you could perform these checks when using `System.arraycopy`:

```java
Object[] src = {1, 2, 3};
Object[] dest = new Object[3];

if (src == null || dest == null) {
    throw new NullPointerException();
}

if (src.getClass() != dest.getClass()) {
    throw new ArrayStoreException();
}

if (src.length > dest.length) {
    throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
}

System.arraycopy(src, 0, dest, 0, src.length);
``` 

In this example, we first check for null arrays, then check for a type mismatch using the `getClass()` method, and finally check for access of data outside array bounds by comparing the lengths of the source and destination arrays. If any of these checks fail, we throw the appropriate exception.
