Please write a java method that Add a role info.
Sure, here's an example Java method that adds a role info:

```
public void addRoleInfo(String roleName, String roleDescription) {
    // Code to add role info to a database or other storage mechanism
    // For example, you could use JDBC to insert the data into a database table
    // Here's some sample code using JDBC:
    try {
        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
        PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO roles (name, description) VALUES (?, ?)");
        stmt.setString(1, roleName);
        stmt.setString(2, roleDescription);
        stmt.executeUpdate();
        conn.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This method takes two parameters: `roleName` and `roleDescription`. It then uses JDBC to insert the data into a database table called `roles`. You can modify this code to use a different storage mechanism if needed.

Please check when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the setQueryTimeout method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running Statement for java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLTimeoutException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `addRoleInfo` method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the statement if the timeout has been exceeded:

```
public void addRoleInfo(String roleName, String roleDescription, int queryTimeout) throws SQLException {
    try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password")) {
        PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO roles (name, description) VALUES (?, ?)");
        stmt.setString(1, roleName);
        stmt.setString(2, roleDescription);
        stmt.setQueryTimeout(queryTimeout);
        stmt.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            // Attempt to cancel the statement if the timeout has been exceeded
            stmt.cancel();
        }
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This version of the method takes an additional parameter `queryTimeout` which specifies the maximum number of seconds that the statement should be allowed to run before timing out. The `setQueryTimeout` method is called on the `PreparedStatement` object to set the timeout value.

The method then uses a try-with-resources block to automatically close the `Connection` object when the block is exited. Inside the block, the `PreparedStatement` is executed using the `executeUpdate` method.

If a `SQLException` is thrown, the method checks if it is an instance of `SQLTimeoutException`. If it is, the method attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel` method on the `PreparedStatement` object. The exception is then re-thrown to the calling code.
