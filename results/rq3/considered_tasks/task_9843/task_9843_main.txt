Please write a java method that Returns the number of unallocated bytes in the partition named by this abstract path name.
Here's a Java method that returns the number of unallocated bytes in the partition named by the abstract path name:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class UnallocatedBytes {

    public static long getUnallocatedBytes(String path) {
        File file = new File(path);
        long unallocatedBytes = file.getFreeSpace();
        return unallocatedBytes;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String path = "C:\\";
        long unallocatedBytes = getUnallocatedBytes(path);
        System.out.println("Unallocated bytes in " + path + ": " + unallocatedBytes);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `getUnallocatedBytes` method takes a `String` parameter `path` which represents the abstract path name of the partition. The method creates a `File` object using the path and then calls the `getFreeSpace` method to get the number of unallocated bytes in the partition. The method returns this value as a `long`.

The `main` method is just an example of how to use the `getUnallocatedBytes` method. It calls the method with a path of "C:\\" (which represents the C drive on a Windows system) and then prints the result to the console.

Please check If a security manager has been installed and it denies          RuntimePermission("getFileSystemAttributes")          or its SecurityManager.checkRead(String) method denies          read access to the file named by this abstract pathname for java.io.File.getFreeSpace() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here's the modified `getUnallocatedBytes` method that checks for the security manager and throws a `SecurityException` if the security manager denies access:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.security.AccessController;
import java.security.PrivilegedAction;

public class UnallocatedBytes {

    public static long getUnallocatedBytes(String path) {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("getFileSystemAttributes"));
            File file = new File(path);
            sm.checkRead(file.getPath());
        }
        long unallocatedBytes = AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Long>() {
            public Long run() {
                File file = new File(path);
                return file.getFreeSpace();
            }
        });
        return unallocatedBytes;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String path = "C:\\";
        long unallocatedBytes = getUnallocatedBytes(path);
        System.out.println("Unallocated bytes in " + path + ": " + unallocatedBytes);
    }
}
```

In this modified version, we first check if a security manager is installed using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, we check if it has permission to get file system attributes using `sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("getFileSystemAttributes"))`. We also check if the security manager allows read access to the file using `sm.checkRead(file.getPath())`.

If the security manager allows access, we use `AccessController.doPrivileged` to execute the `getFreeSpace` method with the necessary privileges. If the security manager denies access, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

Note that this code assumes that the security manager is installed and configured to deny access to the `getFileSystemAttributes` permission or the file read permission. If no security manager is present, the code will execute without any security checks.
