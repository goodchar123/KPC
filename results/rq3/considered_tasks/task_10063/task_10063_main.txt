Please write a java method that Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from the current underlying input stream without blocking by the next invocation of a method for the current underlying input stream.
Here's a Java method that returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from the current underlying input stream without blocking by the next invocation of a method for the current underlying input stream:

```java
public int availableWithoutBlocking(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    if (inputStream == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("InputStream cannot be null");
    }
    if (inputStream instanceof BufferedInputStream) {
        return ((BufferedInputStream) inputStream).available();
    }
    if (inputStream instanceof ByteArrayInputStream) {
        return ((ByteArrayInputStream) inputStream).available();
    }
    if (inputStream instanceof FileInputStream) {
        return ((FileInputStream) inputStream).available();
    }
    if (inputStream instanceof ObjectInputStream) {
        return ((ObjectInputStream) inputStream).available();
    }
    if (inputStream instanceof PipedInputStream) {
        return ((PipedInputStream) inputStream).available();
    }
    if (inputStream instanceof SequenceInputStream) {
        return ((SequenceInputStream) inputStream).available();
    }
    if (inputStream instanceof StringBufferInputStream) {
        return ((StringBufferInputStream) inputStream).available();
    }
    return inputStream.available();
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as input and returns an integer value representing the estimated number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from the input stream without blocking. The method first checks if the input stream is an instance of any of the known subclasses of `InputStream` that provide their own implementation of the `available()` method. If it is, the method calls the appropriate `available()` method for that subclass. If the input stream is not an instance of any of the known subclasses, the method calls the default `available()` method for the `InputStream` class. If the input stream is null, the method throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.

        if (bufferedInputStream.available() == 0 && bufferedInputStream.markSupported()) {
            bufferedInputStream.mark(1);
            int result = bufferedInputStream.read();
            bufferedInputStream.reset();
            return result == -1 ? 0 : 1;
