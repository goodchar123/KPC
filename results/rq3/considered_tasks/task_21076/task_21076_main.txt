Please write a java method that Retrieves the major version number of the underlying database.
Assuming you are using JDBC to connect to the database, you can use the following Java method to retrieve the major version number of the underlying database:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public int getDatabaseMajorVersion(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    return metaData.getDatabaseMajorVersion();
}
```

This method takes a `Connection` object as input and returns an `int` representing the major version number of the database. It uses the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` object to retrieve the `DatabaseMetaData` object, which contains information about the database. The `getDatabaseMajorVersion()` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` object is then called to retrieve the major version number of the database. If an error occurs, a `SQLException` is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.getMetaData() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.DatabaseMetaData.getDatabaseMajorVersion() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public int getDatabaseMajorVersion(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    try {
        DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
        return metaData.getDatabaseMajorVersion();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the `Connection` object. If the connection is closed, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message.

If the connection is open, the method tries to retrieve the `DatabaseMetaData` object using the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` object. If a database access error occurs, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message and the original exception is included as the cause of the exception.

Finally, if everything is successful, the method returns the major version number of the database.
