Sure, here's an updated implementation that includes the security manager and checks for removed nodes:

```
public void sync() throws BackingStoreException {
    // Check if a security manager is present and denies preferences permission
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("preferences"));
    }

    // Get the root node of the preferences tree
    Preferences rootNode = Preferences.userRoot();

    // Check if the root node or any ancestor has been removed
    if (rootNode.isRemoved()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Root node has been removed");
    }

    // Synchronize all nodes under the root node
    rootNode.sync();
}
```

This implementation first checks if a security manager is present and denies preferences permission. If so, a `SecurityException` is thrown. 

Next, it checks if the root node or any ancestor has been removed using the `isRemoved()` method. If so, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

Finally, it calls the `sync()` method on the root node to synchronize all nodes under it. If any errors occur during the synchronization process, a `BackingStoreException` will be thrown.
