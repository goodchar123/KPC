Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the `clear` operation is supported by the list and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it's not:

```java
public void writeCachedEvents() {
    // Check if there are any cached events
    if (cachedEvents.size() == 0) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Write each cached event to the output mechanism
    for (Event event : cachedEvents) {
        outputMechanism.write(event.toString());
    }
    
    // Clear the cached events if the clear operation is supported
    try {
        cachedEvents.clear();
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Clear operation is not supported by this list", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a `try-catch` block to attempt to clear the cached events list using the `clear` method. If the `clear` method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`, the method catches the exception and throws a new `UnsupportedOperationException` with a message indicating that the clear operation is not supported by the list. The original exception is included as the cause of the new exception for debugging purposes.
