Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static LocalTime withMinute(LocalTime time, int minute) {
    try {
        return time.withMinute(minute);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid minute value: " + minute, e);
    }
}

public static LocalTime of(int hour, int minute) {
    try {
        return LocalTime.of(hour, minute);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid hour or minute value: " + hour + ", " + minute, e);
    }
}
```

The `withMinute` method now catches a `DateTimeException` that may be thrown if the minute value is out of range, and re-throws it with a more informative error message.

Similarly, the `of` method now catches a `DateTimeException` that may be thrown if either the hour or minute value is out of range, and re-throws it with a more informative error message.

These checks ensure that the LocalTime object being created or modified is valid and within the allowed range of values.
