Please write a java method that Finishes the MAC operation.
Here's an example Java method that finishes a MAC operation:

```java
public byte[] finishMAC(Mac mac) {
    return mac.doFinal();
}
```

This method takes a `Mac` object as input and calls its `doFinal()` method to finish the MAC operation and return the resulting MAC value as a byte array. You can call this method after updating the MAC with all the data you want to include in the MAC calculation.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this Mac has not been initialized. for javax.crypto.Mac.doFinal() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `finishMAC` method that checks if the `Mac` object has been initialized before calling `doFinal()`, and throws an `IllegalStateException` if it hasn't:

```java
public byte[] finishMAC(Mac mac) {
    if (mac == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Mac has not been initialized");
    }
    return mac.doFinal();
}
```

This method first checks if the `Mac` object is `null`, which would indicate that it hasn't been initialized. If it is `null`, the method throws an `IllegalStateException` with an appropriate error message. If the `Mac` object is not `null`, the method calls its `doFinal()` method to finish the MAC operation and return the resulting MAC value as a byte array.
