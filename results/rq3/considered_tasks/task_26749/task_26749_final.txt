
The code snippet I provided does not call `System.arraycopy`, so there is no need to check for those exceptions. However, if you are using `System.arraycopy` in your code, here are the checks you should perform:

1. To check for access of data outside array bounds, you should ensure that the source and destination arrays have enough space to hold the specified number of elements. If not, you should throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

2. To check for a type mismatch, you should ensure that the source and destination arrays have the same element type. If not, you should throw an `ArrayStoreException`.

3. To check for null arrays, you should ensure that both the source and destination arrays are not null. If either one is null, you should throw a `NullPointerException`.
