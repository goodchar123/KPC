
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
public int getDefaultHoldability(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = null;
    try {
        metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
    }
    
    int holdability = 0;
    try {
        holdability = metaData.getResultSetHoldability();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
    }
    
    return holdability;
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it is closed, we throw a `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

Next, we wrap the call to `conn.getMetaData()` in a try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that might occur due to a database access error. If such an error occurs, we throw a new `SQLException` with the original exception as the cause.

Finally, we wrap the call to `metaData.getResultSetHoldability()` in another try-catch block to catch any `SQLException` that might occur due to a database access error. If such an error occurs, we throw a new `SQLException` with the original exception as the cause.

By doing these checks, we ensure that any errors that might occur during the execution of this method are properly handled and propagated to the caller.
