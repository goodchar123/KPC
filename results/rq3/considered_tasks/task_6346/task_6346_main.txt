Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this duration with the specified duration in milliseconds added.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a duration with the specified duration in milliseconds added:

```java
public Duration addMilliseconds(Duration duration, long millisecondsToAdd) {
    return duration.plusMillis(millisecondsToAdd);
}
```

This method takes in two parameters: the `duration` to which the milliseconds will be added, and the `millisecondsToAdd` that will be added to the duration. The `plusMillis()` method is used to add the specified milliseconds to the duration, and the resulting duration is returned as a copy.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if numeric overflow occurs for java.time.Duration.plusMillis(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for numeric overflow and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it occurs:

```java
public Duration addMilliseconds(Duration duration, long millisecondsToAdd) {
    try {
        return duration.plusMillis(millisecondsToAdd);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while adding milliseconds to duration.");
    }
}
```

This method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `ArithmeticException` that may be thrown by the `plusMillis()` method if a numeric overflow occurs. If an exception is caught, the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message indicating that a numeric overflow occurred while adding milliseconds to the duration.
