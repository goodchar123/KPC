Please write a java method that Resets the stream to the most recent mark.
Here's a Java method that resets the stream to the most recent mark:

```java
public void resetToMark(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    if (!inputStream.markSupported()) {
        throw new IOException("Mark/reset not supported by input stream");
    }
    inputStream.reset();
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as a parameter and checks if mark/reset is supported by the stream. If mark/reset is not supported, an `IOException` is thrown. If mark/reset is supported, the `reset()` method is called on the input stream to reset it to the most recent mark.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this stream has not been marked or if the          mark has been invalidated. for java.io.InputStream.reset() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the stream has not been marked or if the mark has been invalidated before resetting the stream:

```java
public void resetToMark(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    if (!inputStream.markSupported()) {
        throw new IOException("Mark/reset not supported by input stream");
    }
    try {
        inputStream.reset();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Stream has not been marked or mark has been invalidated", e);
    }
}
```

This method first checks if mark/reset is supported by the input stream. If it is, it tries to reset the stream using the `reset()` method. If the stream has not been marked or if the mark has been invalidated, an `IOException` is thrown with an appropriate message.
