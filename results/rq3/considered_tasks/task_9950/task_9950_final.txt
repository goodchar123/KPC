Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the stream has not been marked or if the mark has been invalidated before resetting the stream:

```java
public void resetToMark(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    if (!inputStream.markSupported()) {
        throw new IOException("Mark/reset not supported by input stream");
    }
    try {
        inputStream.reset();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Stream has not been marked or mark has been invalidated", e);
    }
}
```

This method first checks if mark/reset is supported by the input stream. If it is, it tries to reset the stream using the `reset()` method. If the stream has not been marked or if the mark has been invalidated, an `IOException` is thrown with an appropriate message.
