Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error handling you requested:

```java
public static boolean isSameFile(File file1, File file2) throws IOException {
    try {
        Path path1 = file1.toPath();
        Path path2 = file2.toPath();
        boolean isSame = Files.isSameFile(path1, path2);
        return isSame;
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("An I/O error occurred while comparing the files.", e);
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException("A security manager prevented access to the files.", e);
    } catch (InvalidPathException e) {
        throw new InvalidPathException("The abstract path could not be converted to a Path object.", e.getInput(), e.getIndex());
    }
}
```

This version of the method includes try-catch blocks to handle the various exceptions that may be thrown by the `toPath()` and `isSameFile()` methods. If an exception is caught, a new exception is thrown with a more descriptive error message.

Note that the `InvalidPathException` is only thrown if the abstract path passed to `toPath()` is invalid. This is unlikely to occur if the `File` objects were constructed correctly, but it's still good practice to handle this exception just in case.
