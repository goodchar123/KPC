Please write a java method that Join the multicast group.
Sure, here's an example Java method that joins a multicast group:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class MulticastJoiner {
    public static void joinMulticastGroup(String groupAddress, int port) {
        try {
            InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(groupAddress);
            MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(port);
            socket.joinGroup(group);
            System.out.println("Joined multicast group " + groupAddress + ":" + port);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error joining multicast group: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes two parameters: the multicast group address as a string, and the port number as an integer. It creates a new `InetAddress` object from the group address, creates a new `MulticastSocket` on the specified port, and then joins the multicast group using the `joinGroup()` method of the socket. If any errors occur, they are caught and printed to the console.

Please check if a security manager exists             and its checkConnect method doesn't allow the operation for java.net.InetAddress.getByName(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for a security manager and its `checkConnect()` method before calling `InetAddress.getByName()`:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class MulticastJoiner {
    public static void joinMulticastGroup(String groupAddress, int port) {
        SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (security != null) {
            try {
                InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(groupAddress);
                security.checkConnect(group.getHostAddress(), port);
            } catch (SecurityException se) {
                throw new SecurityException("Permission denied for multicast group join", se);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.err.println("Error joining multicast group: " + e.getMessage());
                return;
            }
        }
        
        try {
            InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(groupAddress);
            MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(port);
            socket.joinGroup(group);
            System.out.println("Joined multicast group " + groupAddress + ":" + port);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error joining multicast group: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This code first checks if a security manager is present using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If one is present, it calls `InetAddress.getByName()` and then `security.checkConnect()` with the host address and port number as arguments. If the security manager denies permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown with the original exception as the cause. If there are any other exceptions, they are caught and printed to the console. If there is no security manager, the code proceeds as before.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if no IP address for the               host could be found, or if a scope_id was specified               for a global IPv6 address. for java.net.InetAddress.getByName(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnknownHostException.
Please check if a security manager exists             and its checkConnect method doesn't allow the operation for java.net.InetAddress.getByName(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for both the `UnknownHostException` and `SecurityException`:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class MulticastJoiner {
    public static void joinMulticastGroup(String groupAddress, int port) throws UnknownHostException, SecurityException {
        SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (security != null) {
            try {
                InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(groupAddress);
                security.checkConnect(group.getHostAddress(), port);
            } catch (SecurityException se) {
                throw new SecurityException("Permission denied for multicast group join", se);
            } catch (UnknownHostException uhe) {
                throw new UnknownHostException("Could not find IP address for host: " + groupAddress);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.err.println("Error joining multicast group: " + e.getMessage());
                return;
            }
        }
        
        try {
            InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(groupAddress);
            MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(port);
            socket.joinGroup(group);
            System.out.println("Joined multicast group " + groupAddress + ":" + port);
        } catch (UnknownHostException uhe) {
            throw new UnknownHostException("Could not find IP address for host: " + groupAddress);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error joining multicast group: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This code first checks if a security manager is present using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If one is present, it calls `InetAddress.getByName()` and then `security.checkConnect()` with the host address and port number as arguments. If the security manager denies permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown with the original exception as the cause. If there is no security manager, the code proceeds as before.

If `InetAddress.getByName()` throws an `UnknownHostException`, a new `UnknownHostException` is thrown with a custom message. If there are any other exceptions, they are caught and printed to the console. If there are no exceptions, the code proceeds to join the multicast group as before.
