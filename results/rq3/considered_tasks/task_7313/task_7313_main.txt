Please write a java method that Forcibly terminates the currently running Java virtual machine.
The `System.exit(int status)` method can be used to forcibly terminate the currently running Java virtual machine. The `status` parameter is an integer value that can be used to indicate the reason for the termination.

Here's an example:

```java
public class TerminateVM {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Starting application...");
        
        // Perform some tasks...
        
        // Terminate the VM with status code 0
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `System.exit(0)` call will terminate the Java virtual machine with a status code of 0, indicating a successful termination. If you want to indicate an error condition, you can use a non-zero status code. For example, `System.exit(1)` could be used to indicate a general error condition.

Please check if a security manager exists and its checkExit        method doesn't allow exit with the specified status. for java.lang.System.exit(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the code that checks for the existence of a security manager and its `checkExit` method before calling `System.exit(int)`:

```java
public class TerminateVM {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Starting application...");
        
        // Check for security manager
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            // Check if checkExit method disallows exit with specified status
            try {
                sm.checkExit(0);
            } catch (SecurityException se) {
                throw new SecurityException("Cannot exit with status 0", se);
            }
        }
        
        // Perform some tasks...
        
        // Terminate the VM with status code 0
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if a security manager exists using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, we then call its `checkExit(int status)` method to see if it disallows exit with the specified status (in this case, 0). If the `checkExit` method throws a `SecurityException`, we re-throw it with a more descriptive message.

If no security manager is present, the `checkExit` method is not called and the program continues to terminate normally.
