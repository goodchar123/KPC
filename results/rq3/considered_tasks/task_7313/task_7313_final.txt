Sure, here's an updated version of the code that checks for the existence of a security manager and its `checkExit` method before calling `System.exit(int)`:

```java
public class TerminateVM {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Starting application...");
        
        // Check for security manager
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            // Check if checkExit method disallows exit with specified status
            try {
                sm.checkExit(0);
            } catch (SecurityException se) {
                throw new SecurityException("Cannot exit with status 0", se);
            }
        }
        
        // Perform some tasks...
        
        // Terminate the VM with status code 0
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if a security manager exists using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, we then call its `checkExit(int status)` method to see if it disallows exit with the specified status (in this case, 0). If the `checkExit` method throws a `SecurityException`, we re-throw it with a more descriptive message.

If no security manager is present, the `checkExit` method is not called and the program continues to terminate normally.
