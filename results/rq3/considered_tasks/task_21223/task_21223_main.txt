Please write a java method that Moves the cursor to the end of this ResultSet object, just after the last row.
Here's a Java method that moves the cursor to the end of a ResultSet object:

```java
public void moveCursorToEnd(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    rs.last();
    rs.afterLast();
}
```

This method uses the `last()` method to move the cursor to the last row of the ResultSet, and then uses the `afterLast()` method to move the cursor just after the last row. If there are no rows in the ResultSet, the cursor will be positioned before the first row. 

Note that this method throws a `SQLException` if there is an error accessing the ResultSet.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs; this method is called on a closed result set or the result set type is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY for java.sql.ResultSet.last() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.last() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Please check if a database access error occurs; this method is called on a closed result set or the result set type is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY for java.sql.ResultSet.afterLast() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.afterLast() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public void moveCursorToEnd(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed() || rs.getType() == ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY) {
        throw new SQLException("Invalid ResultSet");
    }
    if (!rs.last()) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("last() method not supported by JDBC driver");
    }
    if (!rs.afterLast()) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("afterLast() method not supported by JDBC driver");
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the ResultSet is closed or has a type of `TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`, and throws a `SQLException` if either of these conditions are true. 

Next, it checks if the `last()` method is supported by the JDBC driver by calling it and checking its return value. If it returns `false`, it means the method is not supported, and a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown.

Finally, it checks if the `afterLast()` method is supported by the JDBC driver by calling it and checking its return value. If it returns `false`, it means the method is not supported, and a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown.

These error checks ensure that the method is only called on a valid and supported ResultSet object.

Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the additional error checking you requested:

    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred", e);
    }
    if (rs.isClosed() || type == ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY) {
        throw new SQLException("Invalid ResultSet");
    }

    }

```

This updated method first tries to get the ResultSet type using the `getType()` method, and throws a `SQLException` if a database access error occurs.

Next, it checks if the ResultSet is closed or has a type of `TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`, and throws a `SQLException` if either of these conditions are true.

Finally, it checks if the `last()` and `afterLast()` methods are supported and successful, and throws a `SQLException` if either of these conditions are false.

These error checks ensure that the method is only called on a valid and supported ResultSet object, and that any database access errors are properly handled.

Finally, it catches any `SQLException` that may occur during the error checking and re-throws it with a more descriptive message.

These error checks ensure that the method is only called on a valid and supported ResultSet object, and that any database access errors are properly handled.
