Please write a java method that Continues a multiple-part encryption or decryption operation (depending on how this cipher was initialized), processing another data part.
Here's an example of a Java method that continues a multiple-part encryption or decryption operation:

```java
public byte[] process(byte[] data) throws IllegalStateException {
    if (cipher == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cipher not initialized");
    }
    return cipher.update(data);
}
```

This method takes in a byte array `data` as input and returns a byte array as output. It first checks if the cipher has been initialized, and throws an exception if it hasn't. Then it calls the `update` method on the cipher object, passing in the data to be processed. The `update` method processes the data and returns the result as a byte array. This method can be called multiple times to process multiple data parts in a single encryption or decryption operation.

Please check if this cipher is in a wrong state (e.g., has not been initialized) for javax.crypto.Cipher.update(byte[]) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the cipher is in a wrong state before calling the `update` method:

```java
public byte[] process(byte[] data) throws IllegalStateException {
    if (cipher == null || !initialized) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cipher not initialized");
    }
    return cipher.update(data);
}
```

This method now checks if the `cipher` object is null or if the `initialized` flag is false before calling the `update` method. If either of these conditions is true, it throws an `IllegalStateException` with an appropriate error message. This ensures that the cipher is in the correct state before processing any data.
