
Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the requested exception handling:

```java
public static void setLookAndFeel(String newLookAndFeel) throws ClassNotFoundException, InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, UnsupportedLookAndFeelException, ClassCastException, NullPointerException, LinkageError, ExceptionInInitializerError {
    if (newLookAndFeel == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("newLookAndFeel cannot be null");
    }
    try {
        Class<?> lnfClass = Class.forName(newLookAndFeel);
        LookAndFeel lnf = (LookAndFeel) lnfClass.newInstance();
        UIManager.setLookAndFeel(lnf);
        SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(frame); // replace 'frame' with your JFrame instance
    } catch (ClassNotFoundException | InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException | UnsupportedLookAndFeelException | ClassCastException | NullPointerException | LinkageError | ExceptionInInitializerError e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

This method now includes additional exception handling for `LinkageError` and `ExceptionInInitializerError`. It checks if the linkage fails or if the initialization provoked by `Class.forName()` fails and throws the appropriate exception.

Note that all the previously handled exceptions are still caught and re-thrown as before.
