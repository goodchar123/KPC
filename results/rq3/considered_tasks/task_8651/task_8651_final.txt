Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks if the task cannot be scheduled for execution or if the task is null for `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService.submit(java.util.concurrent.Callable)` and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Callable<String> task = null; // Set task to null to test NullPointerException
        Future<String> future = null;
        try {
            future = executor.submit(task);
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("Task is null.");
        } catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {
            System.out.println("Task cannot be scheduled for execution.");
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            String result = future.get();
            System.out.println(result);
        } catch (CancellationException e) {
            System.out.println("Computation was cancelled.");
        } catch (ExecutionException e) {
            System.out.println("Computation threw an exception: " + e.getCause().getMessage());
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread was interrupted while waiting for result.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we set the `task` variable to `null` to test for `NullPointerException`. We then wrap the call to `executor.submit(task)` in a try-catch block that catches `NullPointerException` and `RejectedExecutionException`. If the task is `null`, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown and we print a message indicating that the task is `null`. If the task cannot be scheduled for execution, a `RejectedExecutionException` will be thrown and we print a message indicating that the task cannot be scheduled for execution.

If the task is not `null` and can be scheduled for execution, we proceed with the rest of the code as before.
