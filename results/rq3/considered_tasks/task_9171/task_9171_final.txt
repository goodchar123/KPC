Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if no match has yet been attempted or if the previous match operation failed before calling `Matcher.end()`:

```java
public static int getLastMatchOffset(String regex, String input) {
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
    int lastMatchOffset = 0;
    if (!matcher.find()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No match found");
    }
    do {
        try {
            lastMatchOffset = matcher.end();
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Previous match operation failed", e);
        }
    } while (matcher.find());
    return lastMatchOffset;
}
```

This updated method first checks if no match has yet been attempted by calling `Matcher.find()`. If no match has been attempted, it throws an `IllegalStateException` with the message "No match found".

If a match has been attempted, the method enters a loop that calls `Matcher.end()` to get the offset after the last character matched. The loop continues until all matches have been found.

If the previous match operation failed, `Matcher.end()` will throw an `IllegalStateException`. To handle this case, the method catches the exception and re-throws it with a more informative message that includes the original exception as the cause.
