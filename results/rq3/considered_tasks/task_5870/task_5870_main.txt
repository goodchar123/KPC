Please write a java method that Gets the value of the SO_RCVBUF option for this Socket, that is the buffer size used by the platform for input on this Socket.
Here's a Java method that gets the value of the SO_RCVBUF option for a given Socket:

```java
public int getReceiveBufferSize(Socket socket) throws SocketException {
    return socket.getReceiveBufferSize();
}
```

This method takes a Socket object as input and returns an integer value representing the buffer size used by the platform for input on that Socket. The `getReceiveBufferSize()` method is a built-in method of the Socket class that retrieves the value of the SO_RCVBUF option. If an error occurs while retrieving the value, a SocketException is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if there is an error in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error. for java.net.Socket.getReceiveBufferSize() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SocketException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for errors in the underlying protocol:

```java
public int getReceiveBufferSize(Socket socket) throws SocketException {
    int bufferSize = socket.getReceiveBufferSize();
    if (bufferSize < 0) {
        throw new SocketException("Error in underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.");
    }
    return bufferSize;
}
```

This method first retrieves the buffer size using the `getReceiveBufferSize()` method of the Socket class. It then checks if the buffer size is less than zero, which indicates an error in the underlying protocol. If an error is detected, a SocketException is thrown with an appropriate error message. Otherwise, the buffer size is returned.
