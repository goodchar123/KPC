Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for errors in the underlying protocol:

```java
public int getReceiveBufferSize(Socket socket) throws SocketException {
    int bufferSize = socket.getReceiveBufferSize();
    if (bufferSize < 0) {
        throw new SocketException("Error in underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.");
    }
    return bufferSize;
}
```

This method first retrieves the buffer size using the `getReceiveBufferSize()` method of the Socket class. It then checks if the buffer size is less than zero, which indicates an error in the underlying protocol. If an error is detected, a SocketException is thrown with an appropriate error message. Otherwise, the buffer size is returned.
