Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error handling:

```java
import javax.naming.Context;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;
import javax.naming.NameNotFoundException;
import javax.naming.NamingException;

public class UnbindObject {
    public static void unbindObject(String name) throws NamingException {
        try {
            Context context = new InitialContext();
            context.unbind(name);
            System.out.println("Object unbound successfully.");
        } catch (NameNotFoundException e) {
            throw new NameNotFoundException("Intermediate context does not exist for unbinding object: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (NamingException e) {
            throw new NamingException("Error encountered while unbinding object: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method includes a `try-catch` block that catches `NameNotFoundException` and `NamingException` exceptions that may be thrown during the unbinding process. 

If a `NameNotFoundException` is caught, it means that an intermediate context does not exist for the unbinding operation. In this case, the method throws a new `NameNotFoundException` with a message indicating that an intermediate context does not exist.

If a `NamingException` is caught, it means that an error was encountered during the unbinding process. In this case, the method throws a new `NamingException` with a message indicating that an error was encountered during the unbinding process.
