Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the checks you requested:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.DirectoryStream;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.NotDirectoryException;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.security.AccessControlException;
import java.security.Permission;

public class DirectoryOpener {
    public static DirectoryStream<Path> openDirectory(Path directory) throws IOException {
        try {
            return Files.newDirectoryStream(directory);
        } catch (NotDirectoryException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw e;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new IOException("Failed to open directory: " + directory, e);
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may occur when attempting to open the directory using `Files.newDirectoryStream()`. 

If the specified `Path` object does not represent a directory, a `NotDirectoryException` is thrown. If an I/O error occurs, an `IOException` is thrown. If a security manager is installed and the `checkRead()` method fails, a `SecurityException` is thrown. 

If any other exception occurs, it is caught and wrapped in an `IOException` with a message indicating that the directory could not be opened.
