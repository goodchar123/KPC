You're right, it's important to handle the possibility of an `IOException` being thrown by the `read()` method. Here's an updated version of the method that checks for an `IOException` and throws it if one occurs:

```java
public static int readUnsignedByte(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    int value;
    try {
        value = inputStream.read();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error reading input stream", e);
    }
    if (value == -1) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return value & 0xff;
}
```

In this version, we wrap the call to `inputStream.read()` in a try-catch block that catches any `IOException` that might be thrown. If an `IOException` is caught, we re-throw it as a new `IOException` with a more informative error message. This way, the caller of the method can be sure that any `IOException` that is thrown originated from the `read()` method call.
