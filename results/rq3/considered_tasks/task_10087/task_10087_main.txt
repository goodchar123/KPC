Please write a java method that Reads an unsigned 8 bit byte.
Here's a Java method that reads an unsigned 8-bit byte:

```java
public static int readUnsignedByte(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    int value = inputStream.read();
    if (value == -1) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return value & 0xff;
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` as input and reads a single byte from it. If the byte read is -1 (indicating the end of the stream), an `EOFException` is thrown. Otherwise, the byte is returned as an unsigned integer value between 0 and 255. The `& 0xff` operation is used to ensure that the returned value is always in the range 0-255, even if the input byte was negative.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.InputStream.read() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
You're right, it's important to handle the possibility of an `IOException` being thrown by the `read()` method. Here's an updated version of the method that checks for an `IOException` and throws it if one occurs:

```java
public static int readUnsignedByte(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    int value;
    try {
        value = inputStream.read();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error reading input stream", e);
    }
    if (value == -1) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    return value & 0xff;
}
```

In this version, we wrap the call to `inputStream.read()` in a try-catch block that catches any `IOException` that might be thrown. If an `IOException` is caught, we re-throw it as a new `IOException` with a more informative error message. This way, the caller of the method can be sure that any `IOException` that is thrown originated from the `read()` method call.
