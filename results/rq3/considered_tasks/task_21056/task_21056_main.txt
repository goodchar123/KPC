Please write a java method that Retrieves whether a result set's own deletes are visible.
Here's a Java method that retrieves whether a result set's own deletes are visible:

```java
public boolean getResultSetOwnDeletesVisibility(ResultSet resultSet) throws SQLException {
    int resultSetType = resultSet.getType();
    int resultSetConcurrency = resultSet.getConcurrency();
    boolean ownDeletesVisibility = resultSet.getMetaData().supportsResultSetHoldability(ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT);

    if (resultSetType == ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY || resultSetConcurrency == ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY) {
        ownDeletesVisibility = false;
    }

    return ownDeletesVisibility;
}
```

This method takes a `ResultSet` object as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the result set's own deletes are visible. It first checks the result set's type and concurrency to determine whether the result set supports own deletes visibility. If the result set is forward-only or read-only, then own deletes visibility is not supported. Otherwise, it checks whether the result set's metadata supports holdability over commit, which is required for own deletes visibility. The method then returns the boolean value indicating whether own deletes visibility is supported.

Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.getType() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.getConcurrency() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is         called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.getMetaData() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for database access errors and closed result sets:

```java
public boolean getResultSetOwnDeletesVisibility(ResultSet resultSet) throws SQLException {
    if (resultSet.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }

    int resultSetType;
    try {
        resultSetType = resultSet.getType();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred while getting result set type", e);
    }

    int resultSetConcurrency;
    try {
        resultSetConcurrency = resultSet.getConcurrency();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred while getting result set concurrency", e);
    }

    boolean ownDeletesVisibility;
    try {
        ownDeletesVisibility = resultSet.getMetaData().supportsResultSetHoldability(ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred while getting result set metadata", e);
    }

    if (resultSetType == ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY || resultSetConcurrency == ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY) {
        ownDeletesVisibility = false;
    }

    return ownDeletesVisibility;
}
```

This updated method now checks for a closed result set using the `isClosed()` method. It also wraps the calls to `getType()`, `getConcurrency()`, and `getMetaData()` in try-catch blocks to catch any potential database access errors. If an error occurs, the method throws a `SQLException` with a message indicating which method caused the error and the original exception as the cause.
