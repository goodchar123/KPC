Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for I/O errors and throws an `IOException` if necessary:

```java
public static void writeBufferToStream(BufferedReader bufferedReader, Writer writer) throws IOException {
    String line;
    try {
        while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
            try {
                writer.write(line);
                writer.write(System.lineSeparator());
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error while writing to stream", e);
            }
        }
        try {
            writer.flush();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error while flushing stream", e);
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error while reading from buffer", e);
    } finally {
        try {
            bufferedReader.close();
            writer.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // ignore
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, we've added a try-catch block around the `flush()` method call to check for any `IOException` that may occur during the flushing process. If an `IOException` occurs, we throw a new `IOException` with a message indicating that there was an error while flushing the stream.

We've also updated the catch block around the while loop to indicate that an error occurred while reading from the buffer, rather than a general error.

Finally, we've added a finally block that closes both the `BufferedReader` and `Writer` objects, even if an exception is thrown. This ensures that all resources are properly released.

Note that we're also catching any `IOException` that occurs when closing the streams, but we're ignoring them since we've already thrown an exception for any errors that occurred during the main processing loop.
