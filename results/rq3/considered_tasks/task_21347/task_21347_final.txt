
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for query timeout and cancels the currently running statement if the timeout has been exceeded:

```java
public void updateAsciiStream(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, int id, InputStream asciiStream, int queryTimeout) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setAsciiStream(1, asciiStream);
        pstmt.setInt(2, id);
        pstmt.setQueryTimeout(queryTimeout);
        int updateCount = pstmt.executeUpdate();
        if (updateCount == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("No rows were updated");
        }
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        // Attempt to cancel the currently running statement
        pstmt.cancel();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `queryTimeout` which specifies the maximum number of seconds that the driver will wait for the statement to execute. It sets this timeout value using the `setQueryTimeout()` method of the prepared statement.

After executing the update statement, the method checks the update count to ensure that at least one row was updated. If no rows were updated, it throws a `SQLException`.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is caught, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel()` method of the prepared statement, and then re-throws the exception. This ensures that the statement is cancelled if the timeout has been exceeded.
