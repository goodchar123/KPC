Please write a java method that Alter the state of this pseudorandom number generator so as to jump forward a specified distance within its state cycle.
Here's a Java method that jumps forward a specified distance within the state cycle of a pseudorandom number generator:

```java
public static void jumpForward(Random random, int distance) {
    long[] jump = new long[] {0x8f7011ee7a4e98d6L, 0xfc78ff1e5f42c8c4L};
    long[] state = new long[2];
    long[] multiplier = new long[2];
    multiplier[0] = jump[0];
    multiplier[1] = jump[1];
    while (distance > 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 64; j++) {
                if ((jump[i] & (1L << j)) != 0) {
                    state[0] ^= multiplier[0];
                    state[1] ^= multiplier[1];
                }
                next(random, state);
            }
        }
        distance--;
    }
}

private static void next(Random random, long[] state) {
    long oldState = (state[0] << 32) | state[1];
    long newState = random.nextLong();
    state[0] = newState >>> 32;
    state[1] = newState & 0xffffffffL;
    state[0] ^= oldState;
}
```

This method takes a `Random` object and an integer `distance` as input. It uses the `jump` array to define a multiplier that is used to alter the state of the generator. The `state` array is used to store the current state of the generator, and the `multiplier` array is used to store the current multiplier.

The method then loops through the bits of the `jump` array, and for each bit that is set, it XORs the current `state` with the current `multiplier`. It then calls the `next` method to generate the next state of the generator.

After looping through all the bits of the `jump` array, the method decrements the `distance` variable and repeats the process until `distance` is zero.

Note that this method assumes that the `Random` object is an instance of `java.util.Random`. If you are using a different implementation of a pseudorandom number generator, you may need to modify the `next` method to generate the next state of the generator in a different way.

Please check if the string does not contain a             parsable long. for java.lang.Long.parseLong(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NumberFormatException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks if the string can be parsed as a long before calling `Long.parseLong()`, and throws a `NumberFormatException` if it cannot be parsed:

```java
public static long parseLong(String s) throws NumberFormatException {
    if (s == null || s.isEmpty()) {
        throw new NumberFormatException("String is null or empty");
    }
    try {
        return Long.parseLong(s);
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
        throw new NumberFormatException("String does not contain a parsable long: " + s);
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the input string is null or empty, and throws a `NumberFormatException` if it is. It then tries to parse the string as a long using `Long.parseLong()`. If this succeeds, it returns the parsed long value. If it fails, it throws a `NumberFormatException` with a message indicating that the string could not be parsed.

You can use this method to safely parse a string as a long without worrying about the possibility of a `NumberFormatException` being thrown by `Long.parseLong()`.
