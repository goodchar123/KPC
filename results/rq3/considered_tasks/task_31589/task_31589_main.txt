Please write a java method that Closes this FileCacheImageInputStream, closing and removing the cache file.
Here's a Java method that closes a `FileCacheImageInputStream` and removes the cache file:

```java
public static void closeAndRemoveCacheFile(FileCacheImageInputStream stream) throws IOException {
    if (stream != null) {
        File cacheFile = stream.getCacheFile();
        stream.close();
        if (cacheFile != null) {
            cacheFile.delete();
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes a `FileCacheImageInputStream` as input and checks if it's not null. If it's not null, it gets the cache file associated with the stream using the `getCacheFile()` method. Then, it closes the stream using the `close()` method. Finally, it checks if the cache file is not null and removes it using the `delete()` method. If the cache file is null, it does nothing. 

Note that this method throws an `IOException` if there's an error closing the stream or deleting the cache file. You can handle this exception in the calling code using a try-catch block.

Please check If a security manager exists and its SecurityManager.checkDelete(java.lang.String) method denies          delete access to the file for java.io.File.delete() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated code that checks for a security manager and calls its `checkDelete()` method before deleting the cache file:

```java
public static void closeAndRemoveCacheFile(FileCacheImageInputStream stream) throws IOException, SecurityException {
    if (stream != null) {
        File cacheFile = stream.getCacheFile();
        stream.close();
        if (cacheFile != null) {
            SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
            if (sm != null) {
                sm.checkDelete(cacheFile.getAbsolutePath());
            }
            if (!cacheFile.delete()) {
                throw new IOException("Failed to delete cache file: " + cacheFile.getAbsolutePath());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager is present using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If it's not null, it calls the `checkDelete()` method on the security manager, passing in the absolute path of the cache file. If the security manager denies delete access, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the security manager allows delete access or if there's no security manager, the method attempts to delete the cache file using the `delete()` method on the `File` object. If the deletion fails, an `IOException` is thrown.

Note that this method now throws both `IOException` and `SecurityException`, so you'll need to handle both exceptions in the calling code using a try-catch block.
