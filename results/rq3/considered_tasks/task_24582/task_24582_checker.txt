Is the ClassNotFoundException handled or caught for javax.swing.UIManager.setLookAndFeel(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `ClassNotFoundException` is not explicitly caught or handled in the code snippet. It is caught by the general `Exception` catch block, which is not a recommended practice. It is better to catch specific exceptions and handle them accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the InstantiationException handled or caught for javax.swing.UIManager.setLookAndFeel(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `InstantiationException` is not explicitly caught or handled in the code snippet. It is caught by the general `Exception` catch block, which is not a recommended practice. It is better to catch specific exceptions and handle them accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IllegalAccessException handled or caught for javax.swing.UIManager.setLookAndFeel(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IllegalAccessException` is not explicitly caught or handled in the code snippet. It is caught by the general `Exception` catch block, which is not a recommended practice. It is better to catch specific exceptions and handle them accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the UnsupportedLookAndFeelException handled or caught for javax.swing.UIManager.setLookAndFeel(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `UnsupportedLookAndFeelException` is caught and handled in the code snippet by the general `Exception` catch block.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the ClassCastException handled or caught for javax.swing.UIManager.setLookAndFeel(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `ClassCastException` is not explicitly caught or handled in the code snippet. It is caught by the general `Exception` catch block, which is not a recommended practice. It is better to catch specific exceptions and handle them accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.swing.UIManager.setLookAndFeel(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not explicitly caught or handled in the code snippet. It may be thrown if the `info` object or its `className` property is null, but it is not specifically caught or handled. It is better to catch specific exceptions and handle them accordingly.
