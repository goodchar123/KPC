Please write a java method that Reads uncompressed data into an array of bytes.
Here's a Java method that reads uncompressed data into an array of bytes:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class UncompressedDataReader {
    public static byte[] readUncompressedData(String filePath) throws IOException {
        File file = new File(filePath);
        byte[] data = new byte[(int) file.length()];

        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
        fis.read(data);
        fis.close();

        return data;
    }
}
```

This method takes a file path as input and returns an array of bytes containing the uncompressed data from the file. It first creates a `File` object from the file path and initializes a byte array with the length of the file. It then creates a `FileInputStream` object and reads the data from the file into the byte array using the `read()` method. Finally, it closes the input stream and returns the byte array.

Please check If a security manager exists and its SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)          method denies read access to the file for java.io.File.length() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated code that checks for a security manager and calls its `checkRead()` method to ensure that read access to the file is allowed:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class UncompressedDataReader {
    public static byte[] readUncompressedData(String filePath) throws IOException {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            sm.checkRead(filePath);
        }

        File file = new File(filePath);
        byte[] data = new byte[(int) file.length()];

        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
        fis.read(data);
        fis.close();

        return data;
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, it calls its `checkRead()` method with the file path to ensure that read access to the file is allowed. If read access is denied, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If no security manager is present or read access is allowed, the method proceeds to read the data from the file and return it as an array of bytes.

            sm.checkRead(filePath);
        }

        File file = new File(filePath);
        byte[] data = new byte[(int) file.length()];

        FileInputStream fis = null;
        try {
            fis = new FileInputStream(file);
            if (fis.read(data) == -1) {
                throw new IOException("End of stream reached before reading all data");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            if (fis != null) {
                try {
                    fis.close();
                } catch (IOException ex) {
                    // ignore
                }
            }
            throw e;
        }

        try {
            fis.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw e;
        }

        return data;
    }
}
```

If a security manager is present, it calls its `checkRead()` method with the file path to ensure that read access to the file is allowed. If read access is denied, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If no security manager is present or read access is allowed, the method proceeds to read the data from the file.

The `FileInputStream` is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle potential I/O errors. If an error occurs while reading the data, the input stream is closed and the exception is re-thrown. If the end of the stream is reached before all data is read, an `IOException` is thrown.

After reading the data, the input stream is closed in a separate try-catch block to handle potential I/O errors. If an error occurs while closing the input stream, the exception is thrown. Finally, the method returns the array of bytes containing the uncompressed data.
