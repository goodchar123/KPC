Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for I/O errors when creating the output stream and flushing the data:

```java
public void sendUrgentData(Socket socket, byte data) throws IOException {
    // Set the socket's urgent data pointer to 1 byte before the end of the send buffer
    socket.sendUrgentData(0xFF);

    // Send the urgent data byte
    OutputStream out = null;
    try {
        out = socket.getOutputStream();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error creating output stream: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    try {
        out.write(data);
        out.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error sending urgent data: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first declare the `OutputStream` object as `null` and then try to create it using the `getOutputStream()` method. If an `IOException` occurs during this process, we catch it and throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message.

Similarly, when we write the urgent data byte and flush the output stream, we wrap the code in a try-catch block and catch any `IOException` that occurs. Again, we throw a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message if this happens.

By doing this, we can provide more detailed error messages to the caller of the `sendUrgentData()` method, which can help with debugging and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
