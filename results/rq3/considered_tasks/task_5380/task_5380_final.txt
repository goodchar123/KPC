Sure, here's an updated version of the method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public void removeNode(Preferences preferences) throws BackingStoreException {
    if (preferences.isRoot()) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Cannot remove root node");
    }
    if (!preferences.nodeExists("")) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Node has already been removed with removeNode() method");
    }
    try {
        preferences.removeNode();
    } catch (BackingStoreException e) {
        throw new BackingStoreException("Failed to remove node due to a failure in the backing store or inability to communicate with it", e);
    }
}
```

This method now checks if the operation cannot be completed due to a failure in the backing store or inability to communicate with it. If an exception is thrown during the `removeNode()` call, it throws a `BackingStoreException` with a message indicating the cause of the failure.

It also checks if the node (or an ancestor) has already been removed with the `removeNode()` method before attempting to remove it. If the node has already been removed, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.

Finally, it checks if the method is invoked on the root node. If it is, it throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
