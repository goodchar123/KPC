Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for security manager and throws `SecurityException` if access is denied:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.security.AccessControlException;
import java.security.Permission;

public class FileHelper {
    public static File[] getFilesInDirectory(String directoryPath) {
        SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (securityManager != null) {
            try {
                securityManager.checkRead(directoryPath);
            } catch (AccessControlException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Access denied to read directory: " + directoryPath, e);
            }
        }
        
        File directory = new File(directoryPath);
        if (!directory.isDirectory()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Path is not a directory: " + directoryPath);
        }
        
        if (securityManager != null) {
            try {
                Permission permission = new FilePermission(directoryPath, "read");
                securityManager.checkPermission(permission);
            } catch (AccessControlException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Access denied to list files in directory: " + directoryPath, e);
            }
        }
        
        return directory.listFiles();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager is present using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If it's present, it calls `SecurityManager.checkRead(directoryPath)` to check if read access is allowed for the directory. If access is denied, it throws a `SecurityException` with a message indicating the access was denied.

Next, it checks if the given path represents a directory using `File.isDirectory()`. If it's not a directory, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.

Then, it checks for security manager again and calls `SecurityManager.checkPermission(permission)` to check if permission is allowed to list files in the directory. If access is denied, it throws a `SecurityException` with a message indicating the access was denied.

Finally, it returns the array of `File` objects representing the files in the directory using `File.listFiles()`.
