Please write a java method that Returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
Sure, here's an example Java method that returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the directory denoted by the given abstract pathname:

```java
import java.io.File;

public class FileHelper {
    public static File[] getFilesInDirectory(String directoryPath) {
        File directory = new File(directoryPath);
        if (!directory.isDirectory()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Path is not a directory: " + directoryPath);
        }
        return directory.listFiles();
    }
}
```

This method takes a string argument `directoryPath` that represents the path of the directory whose files we want to retrieve. It first creates a `File` object from the given path and checks if it represents a directory using the `isDirectory()` method. If it's not a directory, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.

If the path is a directory, it calls the `listFiles()` method on the `File` object, which returns an array of `File` objects representing the files in the directory. This array is then returned by the method.

Please check If a security manager exists and its SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)          method denies read access to the file for java.io.File.isDirectory() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check If a security manager exists and its SecurityManager.checkRead(String) method denies read access to          the directory for java.io.File.listFiles() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for security manager and throws `SecurityException` if access is denied:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.security.AccessControlException;
import java.security.Permission;

public class FileHelper {
    public static File[] getFilesInDirectory(String directoryPath) {
        SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (securityManager != null) {
            try {
                securityManager.checkRead(directoryPath);
            } catch (AccessControlException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Access denied to read directory: " + directoryPath, e);
            }
        }
        
        File directory = new File(directoryPath);
        if (!directory.isDirectory()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Path is not a directory: " + directoryPath);
        }
        
        if (securityManager != null) {
            try {
                Permission permission = new FilePermission(directoryPath, "read");
                securityManager.checkPermission(permission);
            } catch (AccessControlException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Access denied to list files in directory: " + directoryPath, e);
            }
        }
        
        return directory.listFiles();
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager is present using `System.getSecurityManager()`. If it's present, it calls `SecurityManager.checkRead(directoryPath)` to check if read access is allowed for the directory. If access is denied, it throws a `SecurityException` with a message indicating the access was denied.

Next, it checks if the given path represents a directory using `File.isDirectory()`. If it's not a directory, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.

Then, it checks for security manager again and calls `SecurityManager.checkPermission(permission)` to check if permission is allowed to list files in the directory. If access is denied, it throws a `SecurityException` with a message indicating the access was denied.

Finally, it returns the array of `File` objects representing the files in the directory using `File.listFiles()`.
