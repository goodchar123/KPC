Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the additional exception handling you requested:

```java
import java.net.*;

public void leaveMulticastGroup(String groupAddress, String interfaceAddress) throws Exception {
    try {
        InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(groupAddress);
        InetAddress ifaceAddress = InetAddress.getByName(interfaceAddress);
        if (ifaceAddress == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Interface address is null");
        }
        NetworkInterface iface = NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress(ifaceAddress);
        if (iface == null) {
            throw new SocketException("No network interface found for address " + ifaceAddress);
        }
        MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket();
        socket.setNetworkInterface(iface);
        socket.leaveGroup(group);
        socket.close();
    } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
        // No IP address for the host could be found, or if a scope_id was specified for a global IPv6 address
        throw e;
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        // A security manager exists and its checkConnect method doesn't allow the operation
        throw e;
    } catch (SocketException e) {
        // An I/O error occurs
        throw e;
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        // The specified address is null
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Other exceptions
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated code snippet includes additional try-catch blocks to handle the `SocketException` and `NullPointerException` that may be thrown by the `NetworkInterface.getByInetAddress()` method. If either of these exceptions occur, they are re-thrown to be handled by the calling code.
