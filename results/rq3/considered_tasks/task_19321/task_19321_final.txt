Yes, the updated code snippet I provided includes error handling for the case where the registry reference cannot be created. Specifically, it catches the `AccessException` that can be thrown by `LocateRegistry.getRegistry()` and re-throws it as a `RemoteException` with an appropriate error message and the original exception as the cause. Here's the relevant part of the code:

```java
try {
    // Get the registry for the local JVM
    Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry();

    // ...
} catch (AccessException e) {
    // The caller does not have permission to access the registry, so we cannot get a reference to it
    throw new RemoteException("Access denied to registry", e);
} catch (RemoteException e) {
    // An error occurred while getting a reference to the registry
    throw new RemoteException("Error getting registry reference", e);
}
```

So if `LocateRegistry.getRegistry()` throws an `AccessException`, the method will catch it and re-throw it as a `RemoteException` with the message "Access denied to registry" and the original exception as the cause. If `LocateRegistry.getRegistry()` throws a different type of exception, such as `RemoteException`, the method will catch it and re-throw it as a `RemoteException` with the message "Error getting registry reference" and the original exception as the cause.
