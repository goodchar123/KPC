Please write a java method that Closes the line, indicating that any system resources in use by the line can be released.
Here's an example Java method that closes a line:

```java
public void closeLine(Line line) {
    if (line != null) {
        line.stop();
        line.close();
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Line` object as a parameter and checks if it's not null. It then stops the line and closes it, releasing any system resources in use by the line.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the line cannot be closed due to security         restrictions for javax.sound.sampled.Line.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `closeLine` method that checks for security restrictions and throws a `SecurityException` if the line cannot be closed:

```java
public void closeLine(Line line) throws SecurityException {
    if (line != null) {
        try {
            line.stop();
            line.close();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("Cannot close line due to security restrictions", e);
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the `Line` object is not null. It then tries to stop and close the line, but catches any `SecurityException` that may be thrown. If a `SecurityException` is caught, it re-throws it with a more descriptive message indicating that the line cannot be closed due to security restrictions.
