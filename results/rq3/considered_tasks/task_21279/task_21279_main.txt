Please write a java method that Deletes the current row from this ResultSet object and from the underlying database.
Here's an example Java method that deletes the current row from a ResultSet object and from the underlying database:

```java
public void deleteCurrentRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    rs.deleteRow();
}
```

This method takes a ResultSet object as a parameter and calls the `deleteRow()` method on it to delete the current row from both the ResultSet object and the underlying database. If the ResultSet object is not updatable, or if the current row has already been deleted, an SQLException will be thrown.

Please check if a database access error occurs; the result set concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY; this method is called on a closed result set or if this method is called when the cursor is on the insert row for java.sql.ResultSet.deleteRow() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.deleteRow() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Here's the updated Java method that checks for the mentioned exceptions:

```java
public void deleteCurrentRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
    if (rs.getType() == ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY || rs.getConcurrency() == ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is not updatable");
    }
    if (rs.isBeforeFirst() || rs.isAfterLast()) {
        throw new SQLException("Cursor is not on a valid row");
    }
    try {
        rs.deleteRow();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getSQLState().equals("S1000")) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the ResultSet object is closed, or if it is not updatable due to its concurrency level. It also checks if the cursor is not on a valid row for deletion. If any of these conditions are met, it throws a SQLException.

If the deleteRow() method throws an SQLException with SQLState "S1000", it means that the JDBC driver does not support this method. In this case, the method throws a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException. Otherwise, it rethrows the original SQLException.
