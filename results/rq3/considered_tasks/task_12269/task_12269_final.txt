Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error when closing the input stream and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public KeyStore getKeyStore(KeyStoreParameters params) throws Exception {
    KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(params.getType());
    InputStream inputStream = params.getInputStream();
    char[] password = params.getPassword();

    try {
        keyStore.load(inputStream, password);
    } finally {
        if (inputStream != null) {
            try {
                inputStream.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new IOException("Error closing input stream", e);
            }
        }
    }

    return keyStore;
}
```

In this updated version, the `close()` method is called within a `try-catch` block that catches any `IOException` that may occur. If an `IOException` is caught, a new `IOException` is thrown with a message indicating that an error occurred while closing the input stream, and the original exception is included as the cause of the new exception. This ensures that any errors that occur during the closing of the input stream are properly handled and reported.
