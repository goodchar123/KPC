
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors, closed result sets, and unsupported methods:

```java
public boolean isRowUpdated(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
    try {
        return rs.rowUpdated();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getSQLState().equals("S1000")) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the result set is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the `ResultSet` class. If the result set is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate error message.

Next, it tries to retrieve the update status of the current row using the `rowUpdated()` method of the `ResultSet` class. If the JDBC driver does not support this method, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with an appropriate error message. Otherwise, it throws any other `SQLException` that may occur during the method call.

Note that this method now throws two types of exceptions: `SQLException` and `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`. The latter is a subclass of `UnsupportedOperationException` and is used to indicate that a JDBC driver does not support a particular method.
