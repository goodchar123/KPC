List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.util.Deque.isEmpty()`
2. `java.lang.Object.wait()`
3. `java.util.Deque.removeFirst()`

 + From response, we get: ['java.util.Deque.isEmpty()', 'java.lang.Object.wait()', 'java.util.Deque.removeFirst()']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IllegalMonitorStateException handled or caught for java.lang.Object.wait() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `wait()` method is called within a synchronized block on the `deque` object, which means that the current thread holds the lock on the object. If the `wait()` method is called outside of a synchronized block or on an object that the current thread does not hold the lock on, an `IllegalMonitorStateException` will be thrown. However, in this code snippet, the `wait()` method is called within a synchronized block on the `deque` object, so the `IllegalMonitorStateException` is handled implicitly.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the InterruptedException handled or caught for java.lang.Object.wait() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `wait()` method can throw an `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting. In the code snippet, the `InterruptedException` is declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword, which means that the method is declaring that it can throw this exception. If the thread is interrupted while waiting, the method will throw an `InterruptedException`, which can be caught and handled by the calling code.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NoSuchElementException handled or caught for java.util.Deque.removeFirst() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `removeFirst()` method can throw a `NoSuchElementException` if the deque is empty when the method is called. However, this exception is not handled or caught in the code snippet. If the deque is empty when the `removeFirst()` method is called, an unhandled `NoSuchElementException` will be thrown.

Is the NoSuchElementException handled or caught for java.util.Deque.removeFirst() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `NoSuchElementException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature as a possible exception that can be thrown, but it is not explicitly caught or handled within the method.
