
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the JDBC driver supports the `setRowId` method for `java.sql.PreparedStatement`. If the driver does not support this method, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`:

```java
public void setRowIdParameter(PreparedStatement preparedStatement, int parameterIndex, RowId rowId) throws SQLException {
    if (preparedStatement instanceof com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement) {
        // MySQL JDBC driver does not support setRowId method
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("setRowId method is not supported by this JDBC driver");
    } else {
        preparedStatement.setRowId(parameterIndex, rowId);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `PreparedStatement` object is an instance of the MySQL JDBC driver's `com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement` class. If it is, then it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with a message indicating that the `setRowId` method is not supported by this JDBC driver.

If the `PreparedStatement` object is not an instance of the MySQL JDBC driver's `com.mysql.jdbc.PreparedStatement` class, then it calls the `setRowId` method on the `PreparedStatement` object as before.

Note that this method assumes that the MySQL JDBC driver is the only driver that does not support the `setRowId` method. If you are using a different JDBC driver that does not support this method, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
