
Sure, here's an updated version of the `getResult()` method that checks for all the possible exceptions that can be thrown by `Future.get()`:

```
public static <T> T getResult(Future<T> future) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, CancellationException {
    try {
        T result = future.get(); // waits for the computation to complete and retrieves the result
        if (future.isCancelled()) {
            throw new CancellationException("Computation was cancelled");
        }
        return result;
    } catch (CancellationException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (ExecutionException e) {
        Throwable cause = e.getCause();
        if (cause instanceof RuntimeException) {
            throw (RuntimeException) cause;
        } else if (cause instanceof Error) {
            throw (Error) cause;
        } else {
            throw new ExecutionException(cause);
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        future.cancel(true); // cancel the computation if the thread was interrupted
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This version of the method first tries to call `future.get()` to wait for the computation to complete and retrieve the result. Then it checks if the computation was cancelled by calling `future.isCancelled()`. If it was, it throws a `CancellationException` with an appropriate message.

If the computation threw an exception, the method checks the type of the exception and rethrows it as a `RuntimeException` or an `Error` if it is one of those types. Otherwise, it wraps the exception in an `ExecutionException` and throws that.

If the current thread was interrupted while waiting for the computation to complete, the method cancels the computation by calling `future.cancel(true)` and then throws an `InterruptedException`. Note that the `cancel()` method is called with `true` as its argument to interrupt the computation if it is currently running.
