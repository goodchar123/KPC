Please write a java method that Inserts the specified element into the queue represented by this deque (in other words, at the tail of this deque), waiting if necessary for space to become available.
Here's a Java method that inserts an element into a deque:

```java
public void insertElement(Deque deque, Object element) throws InterruptedException {
    deque.putLast(element);
}
```

This method takes a `Deque` object and an `Object` element as parameters. It uses the `putLast()` method of the `Deque` interface to insert the element at the tail of the deque. If there is no space available in the deque, the method will wait until space becomes available. The `putLast()` method throws an `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting for space to become available.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread cannot modify this thread for java.lang.Thread.interrupt() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()`. If not, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```java
public void insertElement(Deque deque, Object element) throws InterruptedException, SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
    }
    deque.putLast(element);
}
```

This method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a `SecurityManager` is installed, it checks if the current thread has permission to modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()` using the `checkPermission()` method. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If no `SecurityManager` is installed, the method proceeds to insert the element into the deque using the `putLast()` method. If there is no space available in the deque, the method will wait until space becomes available. The `putLast()` method throws an `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting for space to become available.
