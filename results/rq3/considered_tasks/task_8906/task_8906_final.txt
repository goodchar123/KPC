Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the current thread is allowed to modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()`. If not, it throws a `SecurityException`:

```java
public void insertElement(Deque deque, Object element) throws InterruptedException, SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("modifyThread"));
    }
    deque.putLast(element);
}
```

This method first checks if a `SecurityManager` is installed using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a `SecurityManager` is installed, it checks if the current thread has permission to modify the thread for `java.lang.Thread.interrupt()` using the `checkPermission()` method. If the current thread does not have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If no `SecurityManager` is installed, the method proceeds to insert the element into the deque using the `putLast()` method. If there is no space available in the deque, the method will wait until space becomes available. The `putLast()` method throws an `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting for space to become available.
