Please write a java method that Atomically sets the value of a variable to the newValue with the memory semantics of setVolatile(java.lang.Object...) if the variable's current value, referred to as the witness value, == the expectedValue, as accessed with the memory semantics of getVolatile(java.lang.Object...).
Here's an example Java method that atomically sets the value of a variable to the newValue with the memory semantics of setVolatile if the variable's current value, referred to as the witness value, == the expectedValue, as accessed with the memory semantics of getVolatile:

```
public static <T> boolean atomicCompareAndSetVolatile(T[] array, int index, T expectedValue, T newValue) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(array);
    if (index < 0 || index >= array.length) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index out of bounds: " + index);
    }
    synchronized (array) {
        T witnessValue = array[index];
        if (witnessValue == expectedValue) {
            array[index] = newValue;
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes an array, an index, an expected value, and a new value as parameters. It first checks that the array is not null and that the index is within the bounds of the array. It then synchronizes on the array to ensure that only one thread can access the array at a time.

The method then gets the current value of the array at the specified index, which is the witness value. If the witness value is equal to the expected value, the method sets the value of the array at the specified index to the new value and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

This method uses synchronized to ensure atomicity and visibility of the operation. The use of synchronized ensures that only one thread can access the array at a time, which prevents race conditions and ensures that the operation is atomic. The use of synchronized also ensures that changes made by one thread are visible to other threads, which ensures visibility.

In `myWait()`, we don't need to check if the current thread is the owner of the monitor or if it was interrupted, since `wait()` already does those checks and throws the appropriate exceptions.

In `myWait(long timeoutMillis)` and `myWait(long timeoutMillis, int nanos)`, we check if the timeout value is negative or if the nanos value is out of range, and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if either condition is true. We also check if the current thread is the owner of the monitor and if it was interrupted, and throw the appropriate exceptions if either condition is true.

In `myNotify()` and `myNotifyAll()`, we check if the current thread is the owner of the monitor, and throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if it is not.
