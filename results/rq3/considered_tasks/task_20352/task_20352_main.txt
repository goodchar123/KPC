Please write a java method that Sets the designated column's number of digits to the right of the decimal point to the given int.
Here's a Java method that sets the number of digits to the right of the decimal point for a given column:

```java
public void setColumnDecimalDigits(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, int decimalDigits) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "ALTER TABLE " + tableName + " MODIFY " + columnName + " DECIMAL(10," + decimalDigits + ")";
    try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {
        stmt.executeUpdate(sql);
    }
}
```

This method takes in a `Connection` object, the name of the table, the name of the column, and the number of decimal digits to set. It then constructs an SQL statement to modify the column's data type to `DECIMAL(10, decimalDigits)`, where `10` is the maximum number of digits allowed for the column. Finally, it executes the SQL statement using a `Statement` object. 

Note that this method assumes that the column already exists in the table and that the table is not currently being used by any other processes.

Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.createStatement() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the setQueryTimeout method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running Statement for java.sql.Statement.executeUpdate(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLTimeoutException.
Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.Statement.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes error handling for the scenarios you mentioned:

```java
public void setColumnDecimalDigits(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, int decimalDigits) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "ALTER TABLE " + tableName + " MODIFY " + columnName + " DECIMAL(10," + decimalDigits + ")";
    try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {
        stmt.setQueryTimeout(10); // set timeout to 10 seconds
        stmt.executeUpdate(sql);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            // handle timeout exception
            throw (SQLTimeoutException) e;
        } else {
            // handle other database access errors
            throw e;
        }
    } finally {
        try {
            if (stmt != null) {
                stmt.close();
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // handle database access errors for closing statement
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method now includes a try-catch block to handle potential `SQLExceptions` that may occur when executing the SQL statement. If a `SQLTimeoutException` is caught, it is re-thrown. If any other database access error occurs, it is also re-thrown.

Additionally, the method now sets a query timeout of 10 seconds using the `setQueryTimeout()` method on the `Statement` object. If the driver determines that the timeout value has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running statement, a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown.

Finally, the method includes a `finally` block to ensure that the `Statement` object is closed properly, even if an exception is thrown. If a database access error occurs when closing the statement, it is also re-thrown.

Please check if a database access error occurs, this method is called on a closed Statement            or the condition seconds >= 0 is not satisfied for java.sql.Statement.setQueryTimeout(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes error handling for the scenarios you mentioned:

```java
public void setColumnDecimalDigits(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, int decimalDigits) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "ALTER TABLE " + tableName + " MODIFY " + columnName + " DECIMAL(10," + decimalDigits + ")";
    try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {
        int seconds = 10; // set timeout to 10 seconds
        if (seconds >= 0) {
            stmt.setQueryTimeout(seconds);
            stmt.executeUpdate(sql);
        } else {
            throw new SQLException("Invalid timeout value: " + seconds);
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            // handle timeout exception
            throw (SQLTimeoutException) e;
        } else {
            // handle other database access errors
            throw e;
        }
    } finally {
        try {
            if (stmt != null) {
                stmt.close();
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // handle database access errors for closing statement
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method now includes a try-catch block to handle potential `SQLExceptions` that may occur when executing the SQL statement. If a `SQLTimeoutException` is caught, it is re-thrown. If any other database access error occurs, it is also re-thrown.

Additionally, the method now checks if the timeout value is greater than or equal to 0 before setting the query timeout using the `setQueryTimeout()` method on the `Statement` object. If the timeout value is less than 0, a `SQLException` is thrown.

Finally, the method includes a `finally` block to ensure that the `Statement` object is closed properly, even if an exception is thrown. If a database access error occurs when closing the statement, it is also re-thrown.
