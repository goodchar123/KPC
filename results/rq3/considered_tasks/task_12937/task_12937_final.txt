Sure, here's an updated version of the `addElementToStream` method that checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state before adding an element. If the builder has already been built, it throws an `IllegalStateException`:

```java
public static void addElementToStream(Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder, String element) {
    try {
        streamBuilder.add(element);
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Builder has already transitioned to the built state");
    }
}
```

This method tries to add the element to the stream being built using the `add()` method of the `Stream.Builder` class. If the builder has already transitioned to the built state, this will throw an `IllegalStateException`. In that case, the method catches the exception and throws a new `IllegalStateException` with a more descriptive message.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder = Stream.builder();
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "apple");
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "banana");
Stream<String> stream = streamBuilder.build();
```

This will create a stream with the elements "apple" and "banana". If you try to call `addElementToStream` after the builder has been built, it will throw an `IllegalStateException` with the message "Builder has already transitioned to the built state".
