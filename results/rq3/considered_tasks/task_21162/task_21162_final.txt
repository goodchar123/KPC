
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that handles all the potential exceptions that may occur when adding elements to the list:

```java
public Stream<Character> readNextAttribute(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    List<Character> attribute = new ArrayList<>();
    int nextByte;
    try {
        while ((nextByte = inputStream.read()) != -1 && nextByte != '\n') {
            try {
                attribute.add((char) nextByte);
            } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
                throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Add operation not supported by this list", e);
            } catch (ClassCastException e) {
                throw new ClassCastException("Class of the specified element prevents it from being added to this list", e);
            } catch (NullPointerException e) {
                throw new NullPointerException("Specified element is null and this list does not permit null elements", e);
            } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Some property of this element prevents it from being added to this list", e);
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error reading from input stream", e);
    }
    return attribute.stream();
}
```

In this version of the method, we added try-catch blocks to handle all the potential exceptions that may occur when adding elements to the list. If any of these exceptions occur, we re-throw them with a more descriptive error message.

Note that we also added a try-catch block around the entire loop to handle any potential `IOException` that may occur when reading from the input stream.
