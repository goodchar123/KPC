Sure, here's an updated version of the code that checks for an error when calling `HttpURLConnection.getResponseCode()`:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

public class RequestTimeoutExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        URL url = new URL("https://www.example.com");
        HttpURLConnection connection = null;
        try {
            connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Failed to open connection: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        connection.setConnectTimeout(5000); // Set a timeout of 5 seconds for the connection
        connection.setReadTimeout(10000); // Set a timeout of 10 seconds for reading the response
        connection.setRequestMethod("GET");
        int responseCode;
        try {
            responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Failed to get response code: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        if (responseCode >= 400) {
            throw new IOException("Server returned error: " + responseCode);
        }
        System.out.println("Response code: " + responseCode);
    }
}
```

In this version, we wrap the call to `HttpURLConnection.getResponseCode()` in a try-catch block that catches an `IOException`. If an `IOException` occurs, we throw a new `IOException` with a message that includes the original exception's message. We also check if the response code is greater than or equal to 400, which indicates an error occurred on the server. If an error occurred, we throw a new `IOException` with a message that includes the response code. This way, the caller of the method can handle the exception appropriately.
