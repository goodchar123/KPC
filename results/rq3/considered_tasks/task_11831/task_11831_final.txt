Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested exception handling:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.util.ServiceConfigurationError;
import java.util.stream.*;

public static Stream<Path> getOrderedZipEntries(Path zipFilePath) throws IOException {
    try {
        FileSystem fileSystem = FileSystems.newFileSystem(zipFilePath, null);
        return Files.walk(fileSystem.getPath("/"))
                    .filter(Files::isRegularFile)
                    .sorted()
                    .onClose(() -> {
                        try {
                            fileSystem.close();
                        } catch (IOException e) {
                            throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
                        }
                    });
    } catch (ProviderNotFoundException e) {
        throw new IOException("Provider not found for ZIP file system", e);
    } catch (ServiceConfigurationError e) {
        throw new IOException("Error loading service provider for ZIP file system", e);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error creating ZIP file system", e);
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Permission denied for creating ZIP file system", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method includes try-catch blocks to handle the following exceptions:

- `ProviderNotFoundException`: thrown when a provider supporting the ZIP file type cannot be located. In this case, we throw an `IOException` with a message indicating that the provider was not found.
- `ServiceConfigurationError`: thrown when an error occurs while loading a service provider for the ZIP file type. In this case, we throw an `IOException` with a message indicating that there was an error loading the service provider.
- `IOException`: thrown when an I/O error occurs while creating the ZIP file system. In this case, we simply re-throw the `IOException` with a message indicating that there was an error creating the ZIP file system.
- `SecurityException`: thrown when a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified permission for creating the ZIP file system. In this case, we throw a `SecurityException` with a message indicating that permission was denied.
