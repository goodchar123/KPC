Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes all the requested checks:

```java
public void appendRoleUnresolvedList(RoleUnresolvedList list, List<RoleUnresolved> targetList) {
    Iterator<RoleUnresolved> iterator = list.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        RoleUnresolved element = iterator.next();
        if (element == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Cannot add null element to target list");
        }
        try {
            targetList.add(element);
        } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Add operation not supported by target list", e);
        } catch (ClassCastException e) {
            throw new ClassCastException("Cannot add element of type " + element.getClass().getName() + " to target list");
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot add element to target list: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            if (targetList.contains(null)) {
                throw new NullPointerException("Cannot add null element to target list");
            } else {
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
    if (iterator.hasNext()) {
        throw new NoSuchElementException("No more elements in RoleUnresolvedList");
    }
}
```

This updated method includes all the requested checks:

- Before adding an element to the target list, the method checks if the element is null. If it is, a `NullPointerException` is thrown, unless the target list already contains null elements, in which case another `NullPointerException` is thrown.
- If the `add()` operation is not supported by the target list, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown.
- If the class of the specified element prevents it from being added to the target list, a `ClassCastException` is thrown.
- If some property of the element prevents it from being added to the target list, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- After iterating over all the elements in the `RoleUnresolvedList`, the method checks if there are no more elements. If there are, a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown.
