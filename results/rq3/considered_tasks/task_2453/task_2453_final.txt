Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if there are fewer than four bytes remaining in the buffer before calling `getFloat()`, and throws a `BufferUnderflowException` if that's the case:

```java
public static Vector loadVectorFromByteBuffer(ByteBuffer buffer, int offset) {
    int remaining
