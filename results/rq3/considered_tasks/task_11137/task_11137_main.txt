Please write a java method that Creates a socket and connects it to the specified remote host at the specified remote port.
Sure, here's an example Java method that creates a socket and connects it to a remote host at a specified port:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class SocketExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "example.com";
        int port = 80;

        try {
            // Create a socket and connect to the remote host
            Socket socket = new Socket(host, port);

            // Do something with the socket...

            // Close the socket when finished
            socket.close();
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            System.err.println("Unknown host: " + host);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error connecting to " + host + ":" + port);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `Socket` object and connect it to the remote host `example.com` on port `80`. We then do something with the socket (which you would replace with your own code), and finally close the socket when we're finished. If there's an error connecting to the remote host, we catch the `UnknownHostException` or `IOException` and print an error message.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when closing this socket. for java.net.Socket.close() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks for an I/O error when closing the socket:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class SocketExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "example.com";
        int port = 80;

        try {
            // Create a socket and connect to the remote host
            Socket socket = new Socket(host, port);

            // Do something with the socket...

            // Close the socket and check for I/O errors
            socket.close();
            if (socket.isClosed()) {
                System.out.println("Socket closed successfully");
            } else {
                throw new IOException("Error closing socket");
            }
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            System.err.println("Unknown host: " + host);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error connecting to " + host + ":" + port);
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we first close the socket using `socket.close()`. We then check if the socket is closed using `socket.isClosed()`. If the socket is closed, we print a message indicating that the socket was closed successfully. If the socket is not closed, we throw an `IOException` with an error message. This ensures that any I/O errors that occur when closing the socket are properly handled.
