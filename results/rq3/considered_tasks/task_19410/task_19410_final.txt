Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks and exceptions:

```java
import javax.smartcardio.*;

public class CardChannelOpener {
    
    public static CardChannel openChannel(Card card) throws CardException {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        
        // Check if a SecurityManager exists and the caller does not have the required permission for getBasicChannel()
        if (sm != null) {
            sm.checkPermission(new CardPermission(card, "getBasicChannel"));
        }
        
        // Check if the card object has been disposed of via the disconnect() method
        if (card.isDisposed()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Card object has been disposed of");
        }
        
        // Get the card's basic channel
        CardChannel basicChannel = card.getBasicChannel();
        
        // Check if a SecurityManager exists and the caller does not have the required permission for openLogicalChannel()
        if (sm != null) {
            sm.checkPermission(new CardPermission(card, "openLogicalChannel"));
        }
        
        // Select the applet or file on the card that you want to communicate with
        // This is an example command to select the Master File (MF)
        byte[] selectMFCommand = {(byte) 0x00, (byte) 0xA4, (byte) 0x04, (byte) 0x00, (byte) 0x00};
        ResponseAPDU selectMFResponse = basicChannel.transmit(new CommandAPDU(selectMFCommand));
        
        // Check if the response indicates success (SW1=0x90, SW2=0x00)
        if (selectMFResponse.getSW1() == 0x90 && selectMFResponse.getSW2() == 0x00) {
            // If successful, open a new logical channel to the card
            CardChannel logicalChannel = card.openLogicalChannel();
            
            // Check if a SecurityManager exists and the caller does not have the required permission for getBasicChannel()
            if (sm != null) {
                sm.checkPermission(new CardPermission(logicalChannel.getCard(), "getBasicChannel"));
            }
            
            // Check if the channel has been closed or if the corresponding Card has been disconnected
            if (logicalChannel == null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Logical channel could not be opened");
            }
            
            return logicalChannel;
        } else {
            // If unsuccessful, throw a CardException
            throw new CardException("Failed to select Master File on card");
        }
    }
    
    public static ResponseAPDU transmitAPDU(CardChannel channel, CommandAPDU command) throws CardException {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        
        // Check if the channel has been closed or if the corresponding Card has been disconnected
        if (channel == null || channel.getCard().isDisposed()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Channel or corresponding Card has been closed or disconnected");
        }
        
        // Check if the APDU encodes a MANAGE CHANNEL command
        if (command.getCLA() == 0x00 && command.getINS() == 0x70) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("APDU encodes a MANAGE CHANNEL command");
        }
        
        // Check if command is null
        if (command == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Command is null");
        }
        
        // Send the command to the card and get the response
        ResponseAPDU response = channel.transmit(command);
        
        // Check if the card operation failed
        if (response.getSW1() != 0x90) {
            throw new CardException("Card operation failed: " + Integer.toHexString(response.getSW()));
        }
        
        return response;
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following checks and exceptions:

- Check if a SecurityManager exists and the caller does not have the required permission for `getBasicChannel()`. If so, throw a `SecurityException`.
- Check if the card object has been disposed of via the `disconnect()` method. If so, throw an `IllegalStateException`.
- Get the card's basic channel using the `getBasicChannel()` method.
- Check if a SecurityManager exists and the caller does not have the required permission for `openLogicalChannel()`. If so, throw a `SecurityException`.
- Send a command to select the Master File (MF) on the card using the `transmit()` method of the basic channel.
- Check if the response indicates success (SW1=0x90, SW2=0x00).
- If successful, open a new logical channel to the card using the `openLogicalChannel()` method of the `Card` object.
- Check if a SecurityManager exists and the caller does not have the required permission for `getBasicChannel()` on the logical channel's card. If so, throw a `SecurityException`.
- Check if the channel has been closed or if the corresponding Card has been disconnected. If so, throw an `IllegalStateException`.
- Return the logical channel.
- If unsuccessful, throw a `CardException`.
- Check if the channel has been closed or if the corresponding Card has been disconnected. If so, throw an `IllegalStateException`.
- Check if the APDU encodes a MANAGE CHANNEL command. If so, throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
- Check if command is null. If so, throw a `NullPointerException`.
- Send the command to the card and get the response.
- Check if the card operation failed. If so, throw a `CardException`.
