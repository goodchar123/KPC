Here's the updated Java method that checks for negative values of `millis` and for interrupted threads when calling `Thread.sleep(long)`:

```java
public void writeBytesToChannel(WritableByteChannel channel, ByteBuffer[] buffers, int offset, int length) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    long bytesWritten = 0;
    while (bytesWritten < length) {
        long bytesTransferred = channel.write(buffers, offset, length);
        if (bytesTransferred == 0) {
            // Handle the case where the channel is non-blocking and no bytes were transferred
            // Wait for the channel to become writable before trying again
            long millis = 10;
            if (millis < 0) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Negative sleep time");
            }
            try {
                Thread.sleep(millis);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Restore the interrupted status of the current thread
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                throw e;
            }
        }
        bytesWritten += bytesTransferred;
        offset += bytesTransferred;
        length -= bytesTransferred;
    }
}
```

This updated method now checks for negative values of `millis` before calling `Thread.sleep(long)`. If `millis` is negative, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

The method also checks for interrupted threads when calling `Thread.sleep(long)`. If the current thread is interrupted while sleeping, the interrupted status of the thread is restored and an `InterruptedException` is thrown.
