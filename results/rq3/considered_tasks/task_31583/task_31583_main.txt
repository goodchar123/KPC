Please write a java method that Flushes all data prior to the given position to the underlying destination, such as an OutputStream or File.
Here's an example Java method that flushes all data prior to the given position to an OutputStream:

```java
public static void flushToPosition(OutputStream outputStream, long position) throws IOException {
    if (outputStream instanceof FileOutputStream) {
        ((FileOutputStream) outputStream).getChannel().truncate(position);
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Output stream must be a FileOutputStream");
    }
    outputStream.flush();
}
```

This method takes an OutputStream and a position as parameters. If the OutputStream is a FileOutputStream, it gets the channel associated with the FileOutputStream and truncates it to the given position. This effectively deletes all data prior to the given position. Finally, the method flushes the OutputStream to ensure that all remaining data is written to the underlying destination. If the OutputStream is not a FileOutputStream, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If this channel was not opened for writing for java.nio.channels.FileChannel.truncate(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NonWritableChannelException.
Please check If this channel is closed for java.nio.channels.FileChannel.truncate(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ClosedChannelException.
Please check If the new size is negative for java.nio.channels.FileChannel.truncate(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check If some other I/O error occurs for java.nio.channels.FileChannel.truncate(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.channels.NonWritableChannelException;

public static void flushToPosition(FileChannel fileChannel, long position) throws IOException {
    if (!fileChannel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    if (!fileChannel.isOpen() || !fileChannel.isOpenForWriting()) {
        throw new NonWritableChannelException();
    }
    if (position < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("New size cannot be negative");
    }
    if (fileChannel.truncate(position) < position) {
        throw new IOException("Failed to truncate file to position " + position);
    }
}
```

This updated method now checks if the FileChannel is open and writable before truncating it to the given position. If the channel is not open for writing, a NonWritableChannelException is thrown. If the channel is closed, a ClosedChannelException is thrown.

Additionally, the method checks if the new size is negative. If it is, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

Finally, if any other I/O error occurs during the truncation process, an IOException is thrown with a descriptive error message.
