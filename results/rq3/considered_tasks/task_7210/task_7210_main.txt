Please write a java method that Changes the priority of this thread.
Sure, here's an example Java method that changes the priority of a thread:

```
public void changeThreadPriority(Thread thread, int priority) {
    thread.setPriority(priority);
}
```

This method takes in a `Thread` object and an integer value for the new priority. It then calls the `setPriority()` method on the thread object, passing in the new priority value. This will change the priority of the thread to the new value specified.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If the priority is not in the               range MIN_PRIORITY to               MAX_PRIORITY. for java.lang.Thread.setPriority(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if the current thread cannot modify               this thread. for java.lang.Thread.setPriority(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the checks you requested:

```
public void changeThreadPriority(Thread thread, int priority) throws IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException {
    if (priority < Thread.MIN_PRIORITY || priority > Thread.MAX_PRIORITY) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Priority value is not in the valid range.");
    }
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkAccess(thread);
    }
    thread.setPriority(priority);
}
```

This updated method first checks if the priority value is within the valid range of `MIN_PRIORITY` to `MAX_PRIORITY`. If it's not, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

Next, it checks if the current thread has permission to modify the priority of the specified thread. This is done by getting the `SecurityManager` and calling its `checkAccess()` method, passing in the thread object. If the current thread doesn't have permission, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

Finally, if both checks pass, the method calls `setPriority()` on the thread object, passing in the new priority value.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If the priority is not in the               range MIN_PRIORITY to               MAX_PRIORITY. for java.lang.Thread.setPriority(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
