Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the checks you requested:

```
public void changeThreadPriority(Thread thread, int priority) throws IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException {
    if (priority < Thread.MIN_PRIORITY || priority > Thread.MAX_PRIORITY) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Priority value is not in the valid range.");
    }
    SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (securityManager != null) {
        securityManager.checkAccess(thread);
    }
    thread.setPriority(priority);
}
```

This updated method first checks if the priority value is within the valid range of `MIN_PRIORITY` to `MAX_PRIORITY`. If it's not, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

Next, it checks if the current thread has permission to modify the priority of the specified thread. This is done by getting the `SecurityManager` and calling its `checkAccess()` method, passing in the thread object
