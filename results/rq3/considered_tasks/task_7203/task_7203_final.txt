Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks if the object's class implements the `Cloneable` interface before calling `super.clone()`. If the class does not implement `Cloneable`, it throws a `CloneNotSupportedException`:

```
public class MyObject implements Cloneable {
    @Override
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        if (!(this instanceof Cloneable)) {
            throw new CloneNotSupportedException("Class does not support cloning");
        }
        return super.clone();
    }
}
```

In this example, we've created a class called `MyObject` that implements the `Cloneable` interface. We've overridden the `clone()` method to first check if the object's class implements `Cloneable` by using the `instanceof` operator. If the class does not implement `Cloneable`, it throws a `CloneNotSupportedException` with a message explaining that the class does not support cloning. Otherwise, it calls `super.clone()` to create a shallow copy of the object.

Note that this is just an example and you should only implement `Cloneable` if you intend to support cloning of your objects.
