Here's the updated Java method that checks if any returned class is not the current class, and if a security manager, s, is present and the caller's class loader is not the same as or an ancestor of the class loader for that returned class and invocation of s.checkPackageAccess() denies access to the package of that returned class for java.lang.Class.getNestMembers(). If any of these conditions are met, it throws a SecurityException:

```java
public static Class<?>[] getNestMembers(Class<?> clazz) {
    Class<?>[] nestMembers = clazz.getNestMembers();
    SecurityManager s = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (s != null) {
        ClassLoader callerClassLoader = getCallerClassLoader();
        for (Class<?> member : nestMembers) {
            if (member != clazz) {
                ClassLoader memberClassLoader = member.getClassLoader();
                if (memberClassLoader != null && !isAncestorClassLoader(callerClassLoader, memberClassLoader)) {
                    String memberPackageName = member.getPackageName();
                    try {
                        s.checkPackageAccess(memberPackageName);
                    } catch (SecurityException se) {
                        throw new SecurityException("Access denied to package " + memberPackageName, se);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return nestMembers;
}

private static ClassLoader getCallerClassLoader() {
    return ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().getParent();
}

private static boolean isAncestorClassLoader(ClassLoader ancestor, ClassLoader child) {
    while (child != null) {
        if (child == ancestor) {
            return true;
        }
        child = child.getParent();
    }
    return false;
}
```

This method first calls the `getNestMembers()` method to get an array of Class objects representing all the members of the nest to which the input class belongs. It then checks if a security manager is present and gets the class loader of the caller. It then iterates through the array of nest members and checks if any member is not the input class. If so, it gets the class loader of that member and checks if it is not the same as or an ancestor of the caller's class loader. If this condition is met, it gets the package name of the member and invokes `s.checkPackageAccess()` to check if the caller has access to that package. If access is denied, it throws a SecurityException.

The `getCallerClassLoader()` method gets the class loader of the caller by getting the system class loader's parent class loader.

The `isAncestorClassLoader()` method checks if the first class loader is an ancestor of the second class loader by iterating through the parent class loaders of the second class loader until it reaches the first class loader or a null class loader.
