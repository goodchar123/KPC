Please write a java method that Create a new XMLStreamWriter that writes to a writer
Sure, here's an example Java method that creates a new `XMLStreamWriter` that writes to a `Writer`:

```java
import javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter;
import java.io.Writer;

public class XmlWriter {
    public static XMLStreamWriter createXmlStreamWriter(Writer writer) throws XMLStreamException {
        XMLOutputFactory factory = XMLOutputFactory.newInstance();
        return factory.createXMLStreamWriter(writer);
    }
}
```

This method takes a `Writer` object as a parameter and returns a new `XMLStreamWriter` object that writes to that writer. It uses the `XMLOutputFactory` class to create a new instance of the factory, and then calls the `createXMLStreamWriter` method on that factory to create the new `XMLStreamWriter`. If an `XMLStreamException` is thrown during this process, it is simply propagated up to the calling method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an instance of this factory cannot be loaded for javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory.newInstance() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw FactoryConfigurationError.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks if an instance of the `XMLOutputFactory` cannot be loaded and throws a `FactoryConfigurationError` in that case:

```java
import javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter;
import java.io.Writer;

public class XmlWriter {
    public static XMLStreamWriter createXmlStreamWriter(Writer writer) throws XMLStreamException {
        XMLOutputFactory factory;
        try {
            factory = XMLOutputFactory.newInstance();
        } catch (XMLStreamException e) {
            throw new FactoryConfigurationError("Unable to load XML output factory", e);
        }
        return factory.createXMLStreamWriter(writer);
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a `try-catch` block to catch any `XMLStreamException` that may be thrown when trying to create a new instance of the `XMLOutputFactory`. If such an exception is caught, a new `FactoryConfigurationError` is thrown with a message indicating that the factory could not be loaded, and the original exception is included as the cause of the error. If no exception is caught, the method proceeds as before and returns a new `XMLStreamWriter` object that writes to the specified `Writer`.
