Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the `clear()` method is supported by the set and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it's not:

```java
public void removeAllElements(Set<Object> set) {
    if (set instanceof java.util.AbstractSet) {
        try {
            set.clear();
        } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("clear() method is not supported by this set", e);
        }
    } else {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("clear() method is not supported by this set");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the set is an instance of `java.util.AbstractSet`, which is a base implementation of the `Set` interface that supports the `clear()` method. If it is, the method tries to call `clear()` on the set. If the method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`, the method re-throws the exception with a more descriptive message.

If the set is not an instance of `java.util.AbstractSet`, the method throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` with a message indicating that the `clear()` method is not supported by the set.
