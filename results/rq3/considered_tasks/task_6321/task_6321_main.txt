Please write a java method that Obtains a Duration representing a number of standard 24 hour days.
Sure, here's a Java method that obtains a Duration representing a number of standard 24 hour days:

```java
public static Duration getDurationFromDays(long days) {
    return Duration.ofDays(days);
}
```

This method takes a long value representing the number of days and returns a Duration object representing that duration. The `ofDays()` method is a static method of the `Duration` class that creates a duration of the specified number of days.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the input days exceeds the capacity of Duration for java.time.Duration.ofDays(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArithmeticException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the input days exceeds the capacity of Duration for `java.time.Duration.ofDays(long)` and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it does:

```java
public static Duration getDurationFromDays(long days) {
    try {
        return Duration.ofDays(days);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Input days exceeds the capacity of Duration");
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch the `ArithmeticException` that is thrown when the input days exceeds the capacity of `Duration`. If this exception is caught, the method throws a new `ArithmeticException` with a custom error message.
