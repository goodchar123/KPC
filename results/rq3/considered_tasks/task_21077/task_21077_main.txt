Please write a java method that Retrieves the minor version number of the underlying database.
Assuming you are using JDBC to connect to the database, you can use the following Java method to retrieve the minor version number of the underlying database:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public int getDatabaseMinorVersion(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    return metaData.getDatabaseMinorVersion();
}
```

This method takes a `Connection` object as input and returns an integer representing the minor version number of the underlying database. It uses the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` object to retrieve the `DatabaseMetaData` object, which contains information about the database. The `getDatabaseMinorVersion()` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` object is then called to retrieve the minor version number. If an error occurs, a `SQLException` is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.getMetaData() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if a database access error occurs for java.sql.DatabaseMetaData.getDatabaseMinorVersion() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the error handling you requested:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public int getDatabaseMinorVersion(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = null;
    try {
        metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
    }
    
    try {
        return metaData.getDatabaseMinorVersion();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the `Connection` object. If the connection is closed, a `SQLException` is thrown with an appropriate message.

Next, the `getMetaData()` method is called on the `Connection` object to retrieve the `DatabaseMetaData` object. If a `SQLException` occurs during this step, it is caught and re-thrown with an appropriate message.

Finally, the `getDatabaseMinorVersion()` method is called on the `DatabaseMetaData` object to retrieve the minor version number. If a `SQLException` occurs during this step, it is caught and re-thrown with an appropriate message.

This should ensure that any database access errors or closed connection errors are properly handled and reported.
