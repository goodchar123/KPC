Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that handles the `MBeanServerConnection.removeNotificationListener(ObjectName, NotificationListener, NotificationFilter, Object)` method and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```
public void removeNotificationListener(MBeanServerConnection mbsc, ObjectName objectName, NotificationListener listener, NotificationFilter filter, Object handback) throws InstanceNotFoundException, ListenerNotFoundException, IOException {
    try {
        mbsc.removeNotificationListener(objectName, listener, filter, handback);
    } catch (InstanceNotFoundException e) {
        throw e; // The MBean name provided does not match any of the registered MBeans.
    } catch (ListenerNotFoundException e) {
        throw e; // The listener is not registered in the MBean, or it is not registered with the given filter and handback.
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e; // A communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server.
    }
}
```

This method takes in an `MBeanServerConnection` object, an `ObjectName` representing the MBean to remove the listener from, a `NotificationListener` object representing the listener to remove, a `NotificationFilter` object representing the filter to use (or `null` if no filter is used), and an `Object` representing the handback object (or `null` if no handback object is used).

The method then calls the `MBeanServerConnection.removeNotificationListener()` method and catches any exceptions that may be thrown. If an `InstanceNotFoundException` is thrown, it means that the MBean name provided does not match any of the registered MBeans, so the method re-throws the exception. If a `ListenerNotFoundException` is thrown, it means that the listener is not registered in the MBean, or it is not registered with the given filter and handback, so the method re-throws the exception. If an `IOException` is thrown, it means that a communication problem occurred when talking to the MBean server, so the method re-throws the exception.

By throwing these exceptions, the calling code can handle them appropriately and provide better error handling.
