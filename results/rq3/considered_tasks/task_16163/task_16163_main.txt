Please write a java method that Generates the shared secret and returns it in a new buffer.
Sure, here's an example Java method that generates a shared secret using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm and returns it in a new buffer:

```java
import javax.crypto.KeyAgreement;
import java.security.KeyPair;
import java.security.KeyPairGenerator;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.PublicKey;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SharedSecretGenerator {

    public static byte[] generateSharedSecret() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        // Generate a key pair for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange
        KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("DiffieHellman");
        KeyPair keyPair = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair();

        // Get the public key from the key pair
        PublicKey publicKey = keyPair.getPublic();

        // Generate a new key agreement object
        KeyAgreement keyAgreement = KeyAgreement.getInstance("DiffieHellman");
        keyAgreement.init(keyPair.getPrivate());

        // Generate the shared secret using the public key
        keyAgreement.doPhase(publicKey, true);
        byte[] sharedSecret = keyAgreement.generateSecret();

        // Return the shared secret in a new buffer
        return Arrays.copyOf(sharedSecret, sharedSecret.length);
    }
}
```

This method uses the `KeyPairGenerator` and `KeyAgreement` classes from the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) to generate a key pair and perform the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The shared secret is then returned in a new buffer using the `Arrays.copyOf` method. Note that this method may throw a `NoSuchAlgorithmException` if the Diffie-Hellman algorithm is not supported by the JCA.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this key agreement has not been initialized or if doPhase has not been called to supply the keys for all parties in the agreement for javax.crypto.KeyAgreement.generateSecret() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `generateSharedSecret()` method that checks if the key agreement has been initialized and if `doPhase()` has been called to supply the keys for all parties in the agreement before generating the shared secret. If the key agreement is not properly initialized, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown:

```java
import javax.crypto.KeyAgreement;
import java.security.KeyPair;
import java.security.KeyPairGenerator;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.security.PublicKey;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SharedSecretGenerator {

    public static byte[] generateSharedSecret() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        // Generate a key pair for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange
        KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("DiffieHellman");
        KeyPair keyPair = keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair();

        // Get the public key from the key pair
        PublicKey publicKey = keyPair.getPublic();

        // Generate a new key agreement object
        KeyAgreement keyAgreement = KeyAgreement.getInstance("DiffieHellman");
        keyAgreement.init(keyPair.getPrivate());

        // Check if the key agreement has been initialized and if doPhase has been called to supply the keys for all parties
        if (keyAgreement.getPrivateKey() == null || keyAgreement.getPublicKey() == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Key agreement has not been properly initialized");
        }

        // Generate the shared secret using the public key
        keyAgreement.doPhase(publicKey, true);
        byte[] sharedSecret = keyAgreement.generateSecret();

        // Return the shared secret in a new buffer
        return Arrays.copyOf(sharedSecret, sharedSecret.length);
    }
}
```

This updated method checks if the private and public keys have been set for the key agreement object before generating the shared secret. If either key is null, it means that the key agreement has not been properly initialized or `doPhase()` has not been called to supply the keys for all parties in the agreement, so an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.
