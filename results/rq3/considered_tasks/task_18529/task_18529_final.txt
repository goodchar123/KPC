Yes, the updated code I provided includes a check for the `beginIndex` parameter in the `substring()` method to ensure that it is not negative or larger than the length of the string. If it is, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown with a custom error message.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```
int index = line.indexOf(":");
if (index < 0 || index >= line.length() - 1) {
    throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Invalid substring index");
}
marginLeft = line.substring(index + 1).trim();
```

This code first checks if the `indexOf()` method returns a valid index for the `:` character in the current line. If the index is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of the line minus 1, it means that the `:` character was not found or is at an invalid position, so an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown.

This error handling mechanism helps to ensure that the `substring()` method is called with valid parameters and prevents any unexpected errors from occurring.
