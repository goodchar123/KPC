Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if any of them are true:

```java
public void appendSubsequence(StringBuffer buffer, CharSequence sequence, int start, int end) {
    if (start < 0 || start > end || end > sequence.length()) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    buffer.append(sequence, start, end);
}
```

This method first checks if `start` is negative, or if `start` is greater than `end`, or if `end` is greater than the length of the character sequence. If any of these conditions are true, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

If none of these conditions are true, the method proceeds to append the subsequence to the buffer using the `append()` method of the StringBuffer class.
