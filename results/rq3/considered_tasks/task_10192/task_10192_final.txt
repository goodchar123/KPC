Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the stream has not been marked or if the mark has been invalidated before resetting the stream:

```java
public void resetToMark(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {
    if (!inputStream.markSupported()) {
        throw new IOException("Mark not supported");
    }
    try {
        inputStream.reset();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Mark has been invalidated or stream has not been marked");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the mark is supported by calling the `markSupported()` method. If the mark is not supported, an `IOException` is thrown.

If the mark is supported, the `reset()` method is called on the `InputStream`. If the mark has been invalidated or the stream has not been marked, an `IOException` is thrown with an appropriate message.
