Please write a java method that Adds an element to the stream being built.
Here's an example Java method that adds an element to a stream being built:

```java
public static void addElementToStream(Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder, String element) {
    streamBuilder.add(element);
}
```

This method takes in a `Stream.Builder` object and a `String` element as parameters. It then adds the element to the stream being built using the `add()` method of the `Stream.Builder` class. 

You can call this method like this:

```java
Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder = Stream.builder();
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "apple");
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "banana");
Stream<String> stream = streamBuilder.build();
```

This will create a stream with the elements "apple" and "banana".

Please check if the builder has already transitioned to the built state for java.util.stream.Stream.Builder.build() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `addElementToStream` method that checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state before adding an element. If the builder has already been built, it throws an `IllegalStateException`:

```java
public static void addElementToStream(Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder, String element) {
    if (streamBuilder.build().isParallel()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Builder has already transitioned to the built state");
    }
    streamBuilder.add(element);
}
```

This method first checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state by calling the `build()` method and checking if the resulting stream is parallel. If it is, then the builder has already been built and an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

If the builder has not been built yet, the method adds the element to the stream being built using the `add()` method of the `Stream.Builder` class.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder = Stream.builder();
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "apple");
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "banana");
Stream<String> stream = streamBuilder.build();
```

This will create a stream with the elements "apple" and "banana". If you try to call `addElementToStream` after the builder has been built, it will throw an `IllegalStateException`.

    }
}
```

This method tries to add the element to the stream being built using the `add()` method of the `Stream.Builder` class. If the builder has already transitioned to the built state, this will throw an `IllegalStateException`. In that case, the method catches the exception and throws a new `IllegalStateException` with a more descriptive message.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Stream.Builder<String> streamBuilder = Stream.builder();
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "apple");
addElementToStream(streamBuilder, "banana");
Stream<String> stream = streamBuilder.build();
```

This will create a stream with the elements "apple" and "banana". If you try to call `addElementToStream` after the builder has been built, it will throw an `IllegalStateException` with the message "Builder has already transitioned to the built state".
