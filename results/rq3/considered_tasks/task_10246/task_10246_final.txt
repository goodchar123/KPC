Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for I/O errors during both the write operation and the closing of the `FileOutputStream`, and throws an `IOException` if either occurs:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class WriteIntToFile {
    public static void writeInt(File file, int value) throws IOException {
        FileOutputStream fos = null;
        DataOutputStream dos = null;
        try {
            fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
            dos = new DataOutputStream(fos);
            dos.writeInt(value);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error writing int to file: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            if (dos != null) {
                try {
                    dos.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new IOException("Error closing DataOutputStream: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            } else if (fos != null) {
                try {
                    fos.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new IOException("Error closing FileOutputStream: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This method now uses a `FileOutputStream` and a `DataOutputStream` separately, so that we can close them individually and check for I/O errors during each close operation. The `try-catch-finally` block ensures that both streams are closed, even if an exception occurs during the write operation. 

If an `IOException` occurs during the write operation, it is caught and re-thrown as a new `IOException` with a custom error message that includes the original exception's message. If an `IOException` occurs during the closing of the `DataOutputStream`, a new `IOException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the original exception's message. If an `IOException` occurs during the closing of the `FileOutputStream`, a new `IOException` is thrown with a custom error message that includes the original exception's message. This way, the calling method can handle the exception appropriately.
