
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for a database access error or a closed connection for `Connection.getMetaData()` and a closed result set for `ResultSet.next()`, and throws a `SQLException` if any of these conditions occur:

```java
public static void getPrimaryKeyColumns(Connection conn, String tableName) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
    }
    DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
    if (metaData == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to retrieve database metadata");
    }
    ResultSet foreignKeys = metaData.getImportedKeys(conn.getCatalog(), null, tableName);
    while (true) {
        try {
            if (!foreignKeys.next()) {
                break;
            }
            String pkTableName = foreignKeys.getString("PKTABLE_NAME");
            String pkColumnName = foreignKeys.getString("PKCOLUMN_NAME");
            System.out.println("Primary key column " + pkColumnName + " in table " + pkTableName + " is referenced by foreign key column " + foreignKeys.getString("FKCOLUMN_NAME") + " in table " + foreignKeys.getString("FKTABLE_NAME"));
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
                throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
            } else {
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
    if (foreignKeys.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the connection is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with a message indicating that the connection is closed.

Next, it checks if the `DatabaseMetaData` object is null. If it is null, it throws a `SQLException` with a message indicating that it failed to retrieve the database metadata.

If neither of these conditions occur, the method proceeds to retrieve the foreign keys using the `getImportedKeys` method and loops through the result set to print out the information about the primary key columns that are referenced by the foreign key columns.

Inside the loop, the method catches any `SQLException` that occurs when calling `ResultSet.next()`. If the error code of the exception is 0, it throws a new `SQLException` with a message indicating that a database access error occurred, and includes the original exception as the cause. If the error code is not 0, it re-throws the original exception.

After the loop, the method checks if the result set is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the result set is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with a message indicating that the result set is closed.
