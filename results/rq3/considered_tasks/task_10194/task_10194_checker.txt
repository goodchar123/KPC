------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is not handled or caught for `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[])` in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature and propagated to the calling method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught for `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[])` in the code snippet. It is thrown explicitly in the `readAndWriteWithNullCheck()` method if either the input or output stream is null.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is not handled or caught for `java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int)` in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature and propagated to the calling method.

List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[])`
2. `java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int)`
3. `java.io.IOException`
4. `java.lang.NullPointerException`

 + From response, we get: ['java.io.InputStream.read(byte[])', 'java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int)', 'java.io.IOException', 'java.lang.NullPointerException']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` thrown by `inputStream.read(buffer)` is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive message, but it is not handled in the code snippet. The method signature includes `throws IOException`, which means that any `IOException` thrown by the method will be propagated up the call stack to be handled by the calling method or the JVM.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is thrown explicitly by the method if either the `inputStream` or `outputStream` parameter is `null`. The method signature includes `throws IOException`, but not `throws NullPointerException`, which means that any `NullPointerException` thrown by the method will be propagated up the call stack to be handled by the calling method or the JVM.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` thrown by `outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead)` is caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive message in the `try-catch` block. The method signature includes `throws IOException`, which means that any `IOException` thrown by the method will be propagated up the call stack to be handled by the calling method or the JVM.

List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
The fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the `readAndWriteWithNullCheck()` method are:

- `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[])`
- `java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int)`

 + From response, we get: ['readAndWriteWithNullCheck()', 'java.io.InputStream.read(byte[])', 'java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` thrown by `inputStream.read(buffer)` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block, but it is not caught or handled in the method signature or in the method body. The method signature declares that it throws an `IOException`, which means that any `IOException` thrown by `inputStream.read(buffer)` will be propagated up the call stack to the method that called `readAndWriteWithNullCheck()`.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `NullPointerException` thrown by `inputStream.read(buffer)` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block of the `readAndWriteWithNullCheck()` method. If a `NullPointerException` is thrown, the method throws a new `NullPointerException` with a more descriptive message.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` thrown by `outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead)` is not caught or handled in the `readAndWriteWithNullCheck()` method. If an `IOException` is thrown by this method call, it will be propagated up the call stack to the method that called `readAndWriteWithNullCheck()`.
