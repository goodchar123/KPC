Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the watch service is closed or interrupted while waiting for the next key:

```
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class WatchServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Path path = Paths.get("C:/example");
        WatchService watchService = FileSystems.getDefault().newWatchService();
        WatchKey watchKey = path.register(watchService, StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_CREATE);

        // Wait for the next watch key for up to 10 seconds
        try {
            watchKey = watchService.poll(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        } catch (ClosedWatchServiceException e) {
            // Watch service is closed
            System.out.println("Watch service is closed.");
            return;
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // Thread is interrupted
            System.out.println("Thread is interrupted.");
            return;
        }

        if (watchKey != null) {
            // Retrieve and remove the next watch key
            try {
                watchKey = watchService.take();
            } catch (ClosedWatchServiceException e) {
                // Watch service is closed
                System.out.println("Watch service is closed.");
                return;
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // Thread is interrupted
                System.out.println("Thread is interrupted.");
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we use try-catch blocks to handle the `ClosedWatchServiceException` and `InterruptedException` that may occur while waiting for the next key or taking the key from the watch service. If the watch service is closed or the thread is interrupted, we print a message and return from the method.
