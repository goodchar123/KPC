Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for service configuration errors and throws a `TransformerFactoryConfigurationError` if necessary:

```
public static TransformerFactory getTransformerFactory() throws TransformerFactoryConfigurationError {
    TransformerFactory transformerFactory;
    try {
        transformerFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
    } catch (TransformerFactoryConfigurationError e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new TransformerFactoryConfigurationError(e.getMessage());
    }
    return transformerFactory;
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any exceptions that may be thrown by the `TransformerFactory.newInstance()` method. If a `TransformerFactoryConfigurationError` is thrown, it is re-thrown to the caller. If any other exception is thrown, a new `TransformerFactoryConfigurationError` is created with the exception message and thrown to the caller. If no exceptions are thrown, the method returns the new instance of the `TransformerFactory`.
