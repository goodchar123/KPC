Please write a java method that Stores this vector into an array of type short[] starting at an offset.
Sure, here's an example Java method that stores a vector into an array of type short[] starting at a specified offset:

```java
public static void storeVector(short[] array, int offset, Vector<Short> vector) {
    for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++) {
        array[offset + i] = vector.get(i);
    }
}
```

This method takes in three parameters: the array to store the vector in, the offset to start storing at, and the vector to store. It then loops through each element in the vector and stores it in the array at the specified offset plus the current index.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the index is out of range            (index < 0 || index >= size()) for java.util.Vector.get(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the index is out of range before getting the element from the vector:

```java
public static void storeVector(short[] array, int offset, Vector<Short> vector) {
    for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++) {
        int index = offset + i;
        if (index < 0 || index >= vector.size()) {
            throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Index out of range: " + index);
        }
        array[index] = vector.get(index);
    }
}
```

This updated method first calculates the index to use for both the array and the vector. It then checks if the index is out of range for the vector and throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if it is. Finally, it stores the element from the vector into the array at the calculated index.
