Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the index is out of range before getting the element from the vector:

```java
public static void storeVector(short[] array, int offset, Vector<Short> vector) {
    for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); i++) {
        int index = offset + i;
        if (index < 0 || index >= vector.size()) {
            throw new ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException("Index out of range: " + index);
        }
        array[index] = vector.get(index);
    }
}
```

This updated method first calculates the index to use for both the array and the vector. It then checks if the index is out of range for the vector and throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if it is. Finally, it stores the element from the vector into the array at the calculated index.
