Please write a java method that Retrieves whether this Connection object is in read-only mode.
Here's a Java method that retrieves whether a Connection object is in read-only mode:

```java
public boolean isConnectionReadOnly(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    return conn.isReadOnly();
}
```

This method takes a Connection object as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the connection is in read-only mode. It uses the `isReadOnly()` method of the Connection class to retrieve this information. If the connection is read-only, the method will return `true`; otherwise, it will return `false`. 

Note that this method throws a SQLException if there is an error retrieving the read-only status of the connection. You may want to handle this exception in your code.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.isReadOnly() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a database access error or a closed connection and throws a SQLException if either of these conditions occur:

```java
public boolean isConnectionReadOnly(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed.");
    }
    try {
        return conn.isReadOnly();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving read-only status of connection.", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the Connection class. If the connection is closed, it throws a SQLException with an appropriate error message.

If the connection is open, the method attempts to retrieve the read-only status of the connection using the `isReadOnly()` method. If a database access error occurs during this process, the method catches the SQLException and throws a new SQLException with a more informative error message that includes the original exception as a cause.

By including these error checks and handling the SQLException appropriately, this method provides more robust error handling and helps ensure that your code can handle unexpected errors that may occur during database access.
