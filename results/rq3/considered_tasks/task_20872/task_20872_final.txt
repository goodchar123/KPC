
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for a database access error or a closed connection and throws a SQLException if either of these conditions occur:

```java
public boolean isConnectionReadOnly(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is closed.");
    }
    try {
        return conn.isReadOnly();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving read-only status of connection.", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection is closed using the `isClosed()` method of the Connection class. If the connection is closed, it throws a SQLException with an appropriate error message.

If the connection is open, the method attempts to retrieve the read-only status of the connection using the `isReadOnly()` method. If a database access error occurs during this process, the method catches the SQLException and throws a new SQLException with a more informative error message that includes the original exception as a cause.

By including these error checks and handling the SQLException appropriately, this method provides more robust error handling and helps ensure that your code can handle unexpected errors that may occur during database access.
