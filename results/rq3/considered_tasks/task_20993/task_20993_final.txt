
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors and closed connections, and also checks for errors when closing the connection:

```java
public boolean supportsPositionedDelete() throws SQLException {
    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
    try {
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn
