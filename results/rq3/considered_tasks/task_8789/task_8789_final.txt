Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for thread interruption and negative permit values:

```java
public void acquirePermits(Semaphore semaphore, int permits) throws InterruptedException, IllegalArgumentException {
    if (permits < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Permits cannot be negative");
    }
    try {
        semaphore.acquire(permits);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the `permits` value is negative. If it is, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

Next, the method calls the `acquire()` method on the semaphore, passing in the number of permits as an argument. If the thread is interrupted while waiting for permits, the method catches the `InterruptedException`, sets the thread's interrupted status, and re-throws the exception.

This updated method ensures that the input values are valid and handles thread interruption correctly.
