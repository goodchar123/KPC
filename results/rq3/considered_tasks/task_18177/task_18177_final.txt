Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks for an I/O error when detaching from the virtual machine and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```
import com.sun.tools.attach.VirtualMachine;

public static void attachToVM(String pid) throws Exception {
    VirtualMachine vm = VirtualMachine.attach(pid);
    try {
        // Do something with the attached virtual machine
    } finally {
        try {
            vm.detach();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // An I/O error occurred when detaching from the virtual machine
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

In this version of the code, the `detach()` method is called within a `finally` block to ensure that it is always called, even if an exception is thrown while working with the virtual machine. If an `IOException` is thrown when detaching from the virtual machine, it is caught and re-thrown as an `IOException` from the `attachToVM()` method.
