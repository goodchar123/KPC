
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for database access errors and closed connections:

```java
public void setQueryTimeout(int seconds) throws SQLException {
    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
    if (conn == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Failed to connect to database.");
    }
    Statement stmt = null;
    try {
        stmt = conn.createStatement();
        if (stmt == null) {
            throw new SQLException("Failed to create statement.");
        }
        stmt.setQueryTimeout(seconds);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (stmt != null) {
            stmt.close();
        }
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.close();
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the connection to the database was successful. If not, it throws a SQLException with an appropriate error message. It then creates a statement object and checks if it was created successfully. If not, it throws another SQLException with an appropriate error message.

The method also includes a try-catch block to catch any SQLExceptions that may occur while setting the query timeout. If an exception is caught, it is re-thrown to the calling method.

Finally, the method closes the statement and connection objects in a finally block to ensure that they are properly closed, even if an exception occurs.
