Please write a java method that Run a non-standard command (or a standard command from a newer version).
Here is an example Java method that runs a non-standard command using the `ProcessBuilder` class:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class CommandRunner {
    public static void runCommand(String command) throws IOException {
        ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder(command);
        Process process = processBuilder.start();
        try {
            process.waitFor();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes a command as a string parameter and uses the `ProcessBuilder` class to start a new process to run the command. The `waitFor()` method is called to wait for the process to complete before returning. 

Note that this method assumes that the command is installed on the system and can be executed from the command line. If the command is not found, an `IOException` will be thrown.

        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes a `String` parameter `command` which represents the non-standard command to be executed. The `ProcessBuilder` class is used to create a new process for the command. The `start()` method is called on the `ProcessBuilder` object to start the process. The `waitFor()` method is called on the `Process` object to wait for the process to complete. If the process is interrupted, an `InterruptedException` is thrown.

Please check if an element of the command list is null for java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check if the command is an empty list (has size 0) for java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Please check if a security manager exists and         its         checkExec         method doesn't allow creation of the subprocess, or         the standard input to the subprocess was         redirected from a file         and the security manager's         checkRead method         denies read access to the file, or         the standard output or standard error of the         subprocess was         redirected to a file         and the security manager's         checkWrite method         denies write access to the file for java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check If the operating system does not support the creation of processes. for java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Here is the updated Java method that includes the requested error handling:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class CommandRunner {
    public static void runCommand(String command) throws IOException {
        if (command == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Command cannot be null");
        }
        if (command.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Command list cannot be empty");
        }
        ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder(command);
        try {
            SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
            if (securityManager != null) {
                securityManager.checkExec(command);
                if (processBuilder.redirectInput() != null) {
                    securityManager.checkRead(processBuilder.redirectInput().file().getPath());
                }
                if (processBuilder.redirectOutput() != null) {
                    securityManager.checkWrite(processBuilder.redirectOutput().file().getPath());
                }
                if (processBuilder.redirectError() != null) {
                    securityManager.checkWrite(processBuilder.redirectError().file().getPath());
                }
            }
            Process process = processBuilder.start();
            try {
                process.waitFor();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Operating system does not support the creation of processes");
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw new SecurityException("Security manager denies access to subprocess");
        }
    }
}
```

This method now checks for null and empty command lists, as well as security manager permissions and operating system support for process creation. If any of these conditions are not met, the appropriate exception is thrown.
