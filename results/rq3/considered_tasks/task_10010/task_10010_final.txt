Sure, here's the updated code snippet with error checking for `OutputStream.write(byte[])`:

```java
import java.io.*;

public class ByteWriter {
    public static void writeBytes(byte[] bytes, String filename) throws IOException {
        OutputStream out = null;
        try {
            out = new FileOutputStream(filename);
            out.write(bytes);
        } finally {
            if (out != null) {
                try {
                    out.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    throw new IOException("Error closing output stream", e);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated code, we use a `try-finally` block to ensure that the `OutputStream` is closed even if an exception is thrown during the write operation. We also check for errors when writing the bytes to the `OutputStream` and when closing the `OutputStream`, and throw an `IOException` if an error occurs.

You can call this method like this:

```java
byte[] bytes = {0b01100101, 0b01101100, 0b01101100, 0b01101111}; // the bytes to write
String filename = "output.bin"; // the filename to write to
try {
    ByteWriter.writeBytes(bytes, filename);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
``` 

This will write the bytes `0b01100101` (which is the ASCII code for the letter 'e'), `0b01101100` (which is the ASCII code for the letter 'l'), `0b01101100` (which is the ASCII code for the letter 'l'), and `0b01101111` (which is the ASCII code for the letter 'o') to the file `output.bin`, and will handle any errors that occur during the write operation or when closing the `OutputStream`.
