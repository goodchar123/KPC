List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.io.FileOutputStream.FileOutputStream(String name)`
2. `java.io.OutputStream.write(int b)`
3. `java.io.OutputStream.close()`

 + From response, we get: ['java.io.FileOutputStream.FileOutputStream(Stringname)', 'java.io.OutputStream.write(intb)', 'java.io.OutputStream.close()']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No.

The fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the `writeByte` method are:

- `java.io.FileOutputStream.FileOutputStream(java.lang.String)`
- `java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[])`
- `java.io.OutputStream.close()`

 + From response, we get: ['writeByte', 'java.io.FileOutputStream.FileOutputStream(java.lang.String)', 'java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[])', 'java.io.OutputStream.close()']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` thrown by `OutputStream.write(byte[])` is not handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` thrown by `OutputStream.close()` is handled and caught in the code snippet.

------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[]) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
The `IOException` is not caught in the `writeBytes` method for the `java.io.OutputStream.write(byte[])` method. It is thrown up to the calling method using the `throws` keyword in the method signature.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.OutputStream.close() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
The `IOException` is caught and handled in the `finally` block for the `java.io.OutputStream.close()` method. It is caught using a `try-catch` block and then re-thrown as a new `IOException` with a custom message.
