------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is declared in the method signature with the `throws` keyword, which means that any `IOException` thrown by the `read` method will be propagated up the call stack to the method's caller, where it can be handled or caught.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is thrown explicitly by the method if the `buffer` parameter is `null`. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack until it is handled or caught by a higher-level method or the application's main method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is thrown explicitly by the method if the `maxBytes` parameter is negative or greater than the size of the `buffer` array. If this exception is thrown, it will propagate up the call stack until it is handled or caught by a higher-level method or the application's main method.

List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)` - used to read bytes from the input stream into the buffer array.
2. `java.lang.NullPointerException` - thrown when the buffer parameter is null.
3. `java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException` - thrown when the maxBytes parameter is negative or greater than the size of the buffer array.

------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is declared in the method signature with the `throws` keyword, indicating that it is a checked exception that must be handled or declared to be thrown by any method that calls this method.

List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
The Java JDK methods used in the method above are:

- `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)`: Reads up to a specified number of bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes.
- `java.io.IOException`: Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred.

 + From response, we get: ['java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int)', 'java.io.IOException']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `readAudioStream` method, but it is not handled or caught within the method itself. It is up to the calling code to handle or catch the exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. If the `buffer` parameter passed to the `readAudioStream` method is `null`, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown by the `read` method of the `InputStream` class. It is up to the calling code to ensure that the `buffer` parameter is not `null`.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. If the `totalBytesRead` parameter passed to the `read` method of the `InputStream` class is negative or greater than the length of the `buffer` array, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown. It is up to the calling code to ensure that the `totalBytesRead` parameter is within the bounds of the `buffer` array.

The Java JDK methods used in the updated `readAudioStream` method are:

- `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)`

 + From response, we get: ['readAudioStream', 'java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes, the `IOException` is caught and handled in the `try-catch` block surrounding the call to `audioStream.read(buffer, totalBytesRead, maxBytes - totalBytesRead)` in the `readAudioStream` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No, the `NullPointerException` is not caught or handled specifically for the `audioStream.read` method in the code snippet. However, a `NullPointerException` is thrown earlier in the method if the `buffer` parameter is `null`.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes, the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is caught and handled in the code snippet. If the `maxBytes` parameter is negative or greater than the length of the `buffer` parameter, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown.
