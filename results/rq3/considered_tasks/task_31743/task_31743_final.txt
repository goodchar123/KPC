
You're right, it's important to handle these potential errors in the `readAudioStream` method. Here's an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```java
public void readAudioStream(InputStream audioStream, byte[] buffer, int maxBytes) throws IOException {
    if (buffer == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Buffer cannot be null");
    }
    if (maxBytes < 0 || buffer.length < maxBytes) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Invalid buffer size");
    }
    int bytesRead = 0;
    int totalBytesRead = 0;
    while (totalBytesRead < maxBytes && bytesRead != -1) {
        try {
            bytesRead = audioStream.read(buffer, totalBytesRead, maxBytes - totalBytesRead);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading from audio stream", e);
        }
        if (bytesRead != -1) {
            totalBytesRead += bytesRead;
        }
    }
    if (totalBytesRead == 0) {
        throw new IOException("No bytes read from audio stream");
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following checks:

- If `buffer` is `null`, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
- If `maxBytes` is negative or greater than the length of `buffer`, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown.
- If an `IOException` occurs while reading from the input stream, it is caught and re-thrown as an `IOException` with a more descriptive error message.
- If no bytes are read from the input stream, an `IOException` is thrown with a descriptive error message.

These checks help ensure that the method behaves correctly and provides useful error messages if something goes wrong.
