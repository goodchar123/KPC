Please write a java method that Updates the designated column using the given input stream, which will have the specified number of bytes.
Here's an example Java method that updates a designated column using an input stream:

```java
public void updateColumnWithStream(int column, InputStream inputStream, int numBytes) throws SQLException {
    // Assume that 'conn' is a valid Connection object and 'stmt' is a valid Statement object
    String updateQuery = "UPDATE my_table SET my_column = ? WHERE id = ?";
    PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(updateQuery);
    pstmt.setBinaryStream(1, inputStream, numBytes);
    pstmt.setInt(2, column);
    pstmt.executeUpdate();
}
```

This method takes in three parameters: the column to update, the input stream containing the data to update the column with, and the number of bytes in the input stream. It then creates a prepared statement with an update query that sets the value of the specified column to the input stream. The `setBinaryStream()` method is used to set the input stream as a parameter for the prepared statement. Finally, the method executes the update query using `executeUpdate()`. 

Note that this method assumes that the table being updated has a column of binary or BLOB type. If the column is of a different type, you will need to modify the query and the corresponding `set` method accordingly.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the setQueryTimeout method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running Statement for java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLTimeoutException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `updateColumnWithStream` method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the statement if the timeout has been exceeded:

```java
public void updateColumnWithStream(int column, InputStream inputStream, int numBytes, int timeoutSeconds) throws SQLException {
    // Assume that 'conn' is a valid Connection object and 'stmt' is a valid Statement object
    String updateQuery = "UPDATE my_table SET my_column = ? WHERE id = ?";
    PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(updateQuery);
    pstmt.setBinaryStream(1, inputStream, numBytes);
    pstmt.setInt(2, column);
    pstmt.setQueryTimeout(timeoutSeconds);
    try {
        pstmt.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0 && "08S01".equals(e.getSQLState())) {
            // Timeout occurred, attempt to cancel the statement
            pstmt.cancel();
            throw new SQLTimeoutException("Query timeout exceeded", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method takes an additional parameter `timeoutSeconds`, which specifies the maximum number of seconds that the query is allowed to run before timing out. The `setQueryTimeout()` method is used to set this timeout on the prepared statement.

The method then attempts to execute the update query using `executeUpdate()`. If a `SQLException` is thrown with an error code of 0 and an SQL state of "08S01", this indicates that a query timeout has occurred. In this case, the method attempts to cancel the statement using `cancel()` and throws a `SQLTimeoutException` with a message indicating that the timeout was exceeded. If any other type of `SQLException` is thrown, it is re-thrown to the calling code.
