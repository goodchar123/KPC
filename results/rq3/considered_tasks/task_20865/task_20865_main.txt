Please write a java method that Retrieves the current auto-commit mode for this Connection object.
Sure, here's a Java method that retrieves the current auto-commit mode for a Connection object:

```java
public boolean getAutoCommit(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    return conn.getAutoCommit();
}
```

This method takes a Connection object as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the auto-commit mode is currently enabled or disabled. If auto-commit is enabled, each SQL statement is automatically committed after it is executed. If auto-commit is disabled, you must manually commit or rollback transactions using the commit() or rollback() methods.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.getAutoCommit() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a database access error or a closed connection before retrieving the auto-commit mode:

```java
public boolean getAutoCommit(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    if (conn == null || conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Connection is null or closed.");
    }
    try {
        return conn.getAutoCommit();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving auto-commit mode: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the Connection object is null or closed. If it is, a SQLException is thrown with an appropriate error message. If the Connection object is valid, the method attempts to retrieve the auto-commit mode using the getAutoCommit() method. If a database access error occurs, a SQLException is thrown with an error message that includes the original exception message.
