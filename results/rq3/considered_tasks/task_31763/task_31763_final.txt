
You are correct. The `notifyAll()` method should throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if the current thread is not the owner of the object's monitor. Here's the updated code snippet:

```
public synchronized void releaseSynchronization(int startLine, int endLine) {
    for (int i = startLine; i <= endLine; i++) {
        if (!Thread.holdsLock(this)) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
        }
        notifyAll(); // releases synchronization for each line
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the current thread is the owner of the object's monitor by calling the `Thread.holdsLock(this)` method. If the current thread is not the owner, it throws an `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

If the current thread is the owner, the method proceeds to release synchronization for each line in the specified range by calling `notifyAll()`.
