Please write a java method that Releases synchronization for the specified lines.
Here's an example Java method that releases synchronization for the specified lines:

```
public synchronized void releaseSynchronization(int startLine, int endLine) {
    for (int i = startLine; i <= endLine; i++) {
        notifyAll(); // releases synchronization for each line
    }
}
```

This method uses the `synchronized` keyword to ensure that only one thread can access it at a time. It takes in two parameters, `startLine` and `endLine`, which specify the range of lines for which synchronization should be released.

The method then uses a `for` loop to iterate through each line in the specified range. For each line, it calls the `notifyAll()` method, which releases any threads that are waiting on that line's monitor.

Note that this method assumes that there are threads waiting on each of the specified lines. If there are no threads waiting, calling `notifyAll()` will have no effect.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the current thread is not               the owner of this object's monitor. for java.lang.Object.notifyAll() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalMonitorStateException.
You are correct. The `notifyAll()` method should throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if the current thread is not the owner of the object's monitor. Here's the updated code snippet:

```
public synchronized void releaseSynchronization(int startLine, int endLine) {
    for (int i = startLine; i <= endLine; i++) {
        if (!Thread.holdsLock(this)) {
            throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
        }
        notifyAll(); // releases synchronization for each line
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the current thread is the owner of the object's monitor by calling the `Thread.holdsLock(this)` method. If the current thread is not the owner, it throws an `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

If the current thread is the owner, the method proceeds to release synchronization for each line in the specified range by calling `notifyAll()`.
