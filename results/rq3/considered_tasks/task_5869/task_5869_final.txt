You're right, it's important to check if the buffer size value is valid before setting it. Here's an updated version of the method that includes the check:

```java
public void setSocketReceiveBufferSize(Socket socket, int bufferSize) throws SocketException, IllegalArgumentException {
    if (bufferSize <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Buffer size must be greater than 0");
    }
    socket.setReceiveBufferSize(bufferSize);
}
```

This method first checks if the buffer size value is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it throws an IllegalArgumentException with a message indicating that the buffer size must be greater than 0. If the buffer size is valid, it calls the `setReceiveBufferSize()` method on the Socket object, passing in the buffer size value. This sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the specified value for the Socket.

Note that this method now throws both a SocketException and an IllegalArgumentException, depending on the type of error that occurs.
