Please write a java method that Listens on an address chosen by the transport service.
Here's an example Java method that listens on an address chosen by the transport service:

```java
import java.net.*;

public class TransportServiceListener {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a new server socket on a random port
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0);

            // Get the local address and port of the server socket
            InetAddress address = serverSocket.getInetAddress();
            int port = serverSocket.getLocalPort();

            // Print the address and port to the console
            System.out.println("Listening on " + address.getHostAddress() + ":" + port);

            // Listen for incoming connections
            while (true) {
                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
                // Handle the incoming connection
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This method creates a new `ServerSocket` on a random port and listens for incoming connections. The `getInetAddress()` method returns the local address of the server socket, which is chosen by the transport service. The `getLocalPort()` method returns the local port number of the server socket. These values can be used to inform clients how to connect to the server.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when waiting for a               connection. for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if a security manager exists and its             checkAccept method doesn't allow the operation. for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check if a timeout was previously set with setSoTimeout and             the timeout has been reached. for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SocketTimeoutException.
Please check if this socket has an associated channel, the channel is in             non blocking mode, and there is no connection ready to be             accepted for java.net.ServerSocket.accept() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalBlockingModeException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class TransportServiceListener {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        try {
            // Create a new server socket on a random port
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0);

            // Get the local address and port of the server socket
            InetAddress address = serverSocket.getInetAddress();
            int port = serverSocket.getLocalPort();

            // Print the address and port to the console
            System.out.println("Listening on " + address.getHostAddress() + ":" + port);

            // Listen for incoming connections
            while (true) {
                try {
                    Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
                    // Handle the incoming connection
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    // Check for specific error conditions
                    if (e instanceof SocketTimeoutException) {
                        // Timeout has been reached
                        throw (SocketTimeoutException) e;
                    } else if (e instanceof SecurityException) {
                        // Security manager doesn't allow the operation
                        throw (SecurityException) e;
                    } else if (e instanceof IllegalBlockingModeException) {
                        // Socket is in non-blocking mode and no connection is ready
                        throw (IllegalBlockingModeException) e;
                    } else {
                        // Other I/O error occurred
                        throw new IOException("Error waiting for connection", e);
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method checks for specific error conditions when waiting for a connection using `serverSocket.accept()`. If any of these conditions are met, the appropriate exception is thrown. If none of these conditions are met, the method continues to listen for incoming connections.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when creating the             input stream, the socket is closed, the socket is             not connected, or the socket input has been shutdown             using shutdownInput() for java.net.Socket.getInputStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if an I/O error occurs when creating the               output stream or if the socket is not connected. for java.net.Socket.getOutputStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error checking you requested for creating input and output streams:

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class TransportServiceListener {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {

            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0);

            // Get the local address and port of the server socket
            InetAddress address = serverSocket.getInetAddress();
            int port = serverSocket.getLocalPort();

            // Print the address and port to the console
            System.out.println("Listening on " + address.getHostAddress() + ":" + port);

            // Listen for incoming connections

                    }
                }

                try {

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
