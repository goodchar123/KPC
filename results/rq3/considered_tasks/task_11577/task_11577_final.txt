Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for preconditions and throws exceptions accordingly:

```java
import java.io.UncheckedIOException;
import java.nio.MappedByteBuffer;

public static void forceBufferToFile(MappedByteBuffer buffer, int position, int size) {
    if (position < 0 || size < 0 || (long)position + (long)size > buffer.capacity()) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    try {
        buffer.force(position, size);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `position` and `size` parameters are within the bounds of the buffer's capacity. If they are not, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Next, it calls the `force()` method of the `MappedByteBuffer` class with the `position` and `size` parameters to force any changes made to the specified region of the buffer's content to be written to the storage device containing the mapped file.

If an I/O error occurs while writing the buffer's content to the storage device, the `force()` method throws an `IOException`. To handle this, the method catches the `IOException` and throws an `UncheckedIOException` instead, which is an unchecked exception that wraps the original `IOException`.
