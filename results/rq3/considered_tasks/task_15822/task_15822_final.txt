Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the watch service is closed before calling `take()` and throws a `ClosedWatchServiceException` if it is closed while waiting for the next key:

```
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.nio.file.WatchKey;

public WatchKey getNextWatchKey(WatchService watcher) throws ClosedWatchServiceException {
    WatchKey key = null;
    try {
        if (!watcher.isOpen()) {
            throw new ClosedWatchServiceException();
        }
        key = watcher.take();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println("Interrupted while waiting for file events.");
    }
    return key;
}
```

This updated method first checks if the watch service is open using the `isOpen()` method. If it is closed, it throws a `ClosedWatchServiceException`. If it is open, it calls `take()` to retrieve the next watch key. If the thread is interrupted while waiting for file events, it will print a message to the console.
