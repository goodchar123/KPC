Please write a java method that Moves the cursor to the front of this ResultSet object, just before the first row.
Here's a Java method that moves the cursor to the front of a ResultSet object:

```java
public void moveToFirstRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    rs.beforeFirst();
}
```

This method takes a ResultSet object as a parameter and uses the `beforeFirst()` method to move the cursor to the front of the ResultSet, just before the first row. If an SQLException is thrown, it will be propagated to the calling method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.beforeFirst() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the JDBC driver supports the `beforeFirst()` method for `java.sql.ResultSet`. If it doesn't, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`:

```java
public void moveToFirstRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    if (!rs.isBeforeFirst() && !rs.isAfterLast()) {
        if (rs.getType() == ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("The JDBC driver does not support this method for a forward-only ResultSet.");
        } else {
            rs.beforeFirst();
        }
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the ResultSet is not already before the first row or after the last row. If it's not, it checks if the ResultSet is forward-only. If it is, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`. Otherwise, it uses the `beforeFirst()` method to move the cursor to the front of the ResultSet.

If an SQLException is thrown, it will be propagated to the calling method.

        }
    }
    if (rs.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("ResultSet is closed.");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the ResultSet is closed. If it is, it throws a `SQLException`. Then it checks if the ResultSet is not already before the first row or after the last row. If it's not, it checks if the ResultSet is forward-only. If it is, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`. Otherwise, it uses the `beforeFirst()` method to move the cursor to the front of the ResultSet.

After moving the cursor, the method checks again if the ResultSet is closed. If it is, it throws a `SQLException`.

If an SQLException is thrown, it will be propagated to the calling method.

After moving the cursor, the method checks again if the ResultSet is closed. If it is, it throws a `SQLException`.

If an SQLException is thrown, it will be propagated to the calling method.
