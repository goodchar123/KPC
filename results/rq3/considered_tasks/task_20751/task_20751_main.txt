Please write a java method that Sets the limit for the maximum number of bytes that can be returned for character and binary column values in a ResultSet object produced by this Statement object.
Here's the Java method that sets the limit for the maximum number of bytes that can be returned for character and binary column values in a ResultSet object produced by a Statement object:

```java
public void setMaxFieldSize(int max) throws SQLException {
    statement.setMaxFieldSize(max);
}
```

This method takes an integer parameter `max` that represents the maximum number of bytes that can be returned for character and binary column values. It throws a `SQLException` if a database access error occurs or the value specified is less than zero.

You can use this method to limit the amount of data returned by a query to avoid performance issues or memory problems.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs, this method is called on a closed Statement            or the condition max >= 0 is not satisfied for java.sql.Statement.setMaxFieldSize(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for a database access error, a closed Statement, and the condition `max >= 0` before calling `setMaxFieldSize()` method:

```java
public void setMaxFieldSize(int max) throws SQLException {
    if (statement.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed.");
    }
    if (max < 0) {
        throw new SQLException("Invalid max field size value.");
    }
    try {
        statement.setMaxFieldSize(max);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Database access error: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the Statement object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

Next, it checks if the `max` parameter is less than zero. If it is, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

Finally, it calls the `setMaxFieldSize()` method on the Statement object and catches any `SQLException` that may occur. If a `SQLException` is caught, it throws a new `SQLException` with a message that includes the original exception's message.
