Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for the various exceptions you mentioned:

```java
public void writeDatagramToChannel(DatagramChannel channel, ByteBuffer buffer, SocketAddress address) throws IOException {
    if (channel.isConnected() && !channel.getRemoteAddress().equals(address)) {
        throw new AlreadyConnectedException();
    }
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }
    if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
        channel.close();
        throw new ClosedByInterruptException();
    }
    if (!address.isResolved()) {
        throw new UnresolvedAddressException();
    }
    if (address.getClass() != channel.socket().getLocalSocketAddress().getClass()) {
        throw new UnsupportedAddressTypeException();
    }
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkConnect(address.getHostName(), address.getPort());
    }
    channel.send(buffer, address);
}
```

This updated method first checks if the channel is already connected to a different address than the one specified in the `address` parameter. If so, it throws an `AlreadyConnectedException`.

Next, it checks if the channel is closed. If so, it throws a `ClosedChannelException`.

It then checks if the current thread has been interrupted while the write operation is in progress. If so, it closes the channel and throws a `ClosedByInterruptException`.

The method also checks if the given remote address is fully resolved and if its type is supported by the channel. If not, it throws an `UnresolvedAddressException` or an `UnsupportedAddressTypeException`, respectively.

Finally, if a security manager is installed, it checks if it permits datagrams to be sent to the given address. If not, it throws a `SecurityException`.

If none of these exceptions are thrown, the method sends the datagram using the `send()` method on the channel.
