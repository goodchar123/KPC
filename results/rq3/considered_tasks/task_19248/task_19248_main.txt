Please write a java method that Shutdown a connection without closing the channel.
Here's a Java method that shuts down a connection without closing the channel:

```java
public void shutdownConnection(SocketChannel channel) throws IOException {
    channel.socket().shutdownOutput();
    channel.socket().shutdownInput();
}
```

This method uses the `shutdownOutput()` and `shutdownInput()` methods of the `Socket` class to shut down the output and input streams of the socket associated with the channel. This effectively shuts down the connection without closing the channel itself. Note that this method may throw an `IOException` if there is an error shutting down the connection.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs when shutting down this socket. for java.net.Socket.shutdownOutput() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check if an I/O error occurs when shutting down this socket. for java.net.Socket.shutdownInput() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for I/O errors when shutting down the socket's input and output streams:

```java
public void shutdownConnection(SocketChannel channel) throws IOException {
    try {
        channel.socket().shutdownOutput();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error shutting down output stream", e);
    }
    try {
        channel.socket().shutdownInput();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error shutting down input stream", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur when calling `shutdownOutput()` and `shutdownInput()`. If an `IOException` is caught, the method throws a new `IOException` with a descriptive error message and the original exception as the cause. This way, the caller of the method can handle the exception appropriately.
