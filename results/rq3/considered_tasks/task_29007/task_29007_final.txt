
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the component is not showing on the screen for `java.awt.Component.getLocationOnScreen()` and throws an `IllegalComponentStateException` if that's the case:

```java
public Rectangle modelToView(JTextComponent textComponent, int pos) throws BadLocationException, IllegalComponentStateException {
    if (!textComponent.isShowing()) {
        throw new IllegalComponentStateException("Component is not showing on the screen");
    }
    Rectangle rect = textComponent.modelToView(pos);
    Point pt = textComponent.getLocationOnScreen();
    rect.translate(pt.x, pt.y);
    return rect;
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `JTextComponent` is showing on the screen using the `isShowing()` method. If it's not showing, it throws an `IllegalComponentStateException` with an appropriate error message.

If the component is showing, the method proceeds to get the bounding rectangle of the character in the document model coordinate space using the `modelToView` method of the `JTextComponent`. 

Next, it gets the location of the `JTextComponent` on the screen using the `getLocationOnScreen` method and translates the bounding rectangle to the view coordinate space by adding the x and y coordinates of the `JTextComponent` location to the rectangle's x and y coordinates.

Finally, the method returns the translated rectangle representing the character's position in the view coordinate space. 

Note that this method throws a `BadLocationException` if the given position is invalid in the document model.
