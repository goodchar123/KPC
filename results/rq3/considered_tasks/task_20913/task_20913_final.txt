
Here's the updated Java method that includes the error handling and exception throwing you requested:

```java
public void requestCompleted() throws SQLException, SQLTimeoutException {
    // Get the current thread's JDBC connection
    Connection conn = getConnection();

    try {
        // Create a statement to execute the hint command
        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();

        try {
            // Execute the hint command to notify the driver that the request has completed
            stmt.execute("/*+ HINT */");
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Check for a closed connection or statement
            if (conn.isClosed() || stmt.isClosed()) {
                throw new SQLException("Connection or statement is closed", e);
            }
            // Check for a query timeout
            if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
                throw (SQLTimeoutException) e;
            }
            // Rethrow any other SQLExceptions
            throw e;
        } finally {
            // Close the statement
            stmt.close();
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Check for a closed connection
        if (conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed", e);
        }
        // Rethrow any other SQLExceptions
        throw e;
    } finally {
        // Close the connection
        conn.close();
    }
}
```

This updated method includes try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of the method. It checks for a closed connection or statement, a query timeout, or any other SQLExceptions that may occur. If any of these exceptions occur, the method throws the appropriate exception. Finally, the method closes the statement and connection in their respective finally blocks.
