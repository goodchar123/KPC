You are correct, it is important to handle the cases where the first byte cannot be read or if the byte array is null. Here's an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```java
public void writeBytesToSQLOutputImpl(SQLOutputImpl sqlOutput, InputStream inputStream) throws SQLException, IOException {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int bytesRead;
    while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
        sqlOutput.writeBytes(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
    }
    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        throw new IOException("End of stream reached before any bytes could be read.");
    }
    if (buffer == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Byte array is null.");
    }
}
```

This updated method checks if the `read` method returns -1, which indicates that the end of the stream has been reached before any bytes could be read. It also checks if the byte array is null before attempting to read from the input stream. If either of these conditions are true, an appropriate exception is thrown.
