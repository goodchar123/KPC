Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for all the conditions you mentioned:

```java
public static String replaceWithMatcherResult(Matcher matcher, Function<MatchResult, String> replacer) {
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    while (matcher.find()) {
        if (matcher.hitEnd() || matcher.requireEnd()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No match has yet been attempted, or previous match operation failed");
        }
        try {
            matcher.appendReplacement(sb, replacer.apply(matcher.toMatchResult()));
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            if (e.getMessage().startsWith("No group with name")) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Replacement string refers to a named capturing group that does not exist in the pattern", e);
            } else {
                throw e;
            }
        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Replacement string refers to a capturing group that does not exist in the pattern");
        }
    }
    matcher.appendTail(sb);
    return sb.toString();
}
```

This updated method checks for the following conditions:

- If no match has yet been attempted, or if the previous match operation failed, it throws an `IllegalStateException`.
- If the replacement string refers to a named capturing group that does not exist in the pattern, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.
- If the replacement string refers to a capturing group that does not exist in the pattern, it throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The method uses the `hitEnd()` and `requireEnd()` methods of the `Matcher` object to check if a match has been attempted and if the previous match operation failed. It also catches `IllegalArgumentException` and `IndexOutOfBoundsException` thrown by the `appendReplacement()` method and rethrows them with more specific error messages.
