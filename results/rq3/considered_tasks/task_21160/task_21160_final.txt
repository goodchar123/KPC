
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for any I/O errors when reading from the input stream:

```java
import java.io.DataInputStream;
import java.io.EOFException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.sql.Timestamp;

public class StreamReader {
    private DataInputStream inputStream;

    public Timestamp readNextTimestamp() throws IOException {
        if (inputStream == null) {
            throw new IOException("Stream closed");
        }
        if (inputStream.available() < 8) {
            throw new EOFException("End of stream reached before reading eight bytes");
        }
        try {
            long timestampValue = inputStream.readLong();
            return new Timestamp(timestampValue);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error reading from input stream", e);
        }
    }

    public void close() throws IOException {
        if (inputStream != null) {
            inputStream.close();
            inputStream = null;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the input stream is null, which indicates that the stream has been closed. If the stream is closed, it throws an `IOException` with a message indicating that the stream is closed.

If the stream is not closed, the method checks if the input stream has at least eight bytes available to read using the `available()` method of the `DataInputStream` class. If there are less than eight bytes available, it throws an `EOFException` with a message indicating that the end of the stream has been reached before reading eight bytes.

If there are at least eight bytes available, the method attempts to read the next long value from the stream using the `readLong()` method of the `DataInputStream` class. If an I/O error occurs during the read operation, the method throws an `IOException` with a message indicating that an error occurred while reading from the input stream.

If the read operation is successful, the method creates a new `Timestamp` object using the `Timestamp(long time)` constructor and returns it.

Additionally, I have added a `close()` method to the class that closes the input stream and sets it to null. This method should be called when the stream is no longer needed to free up system resources.
