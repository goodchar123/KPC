Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static long getFieldValue(Instant instant, ChronoField field) {
    try {
        return instant.getLong(field);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Value for field " + field + " cannot be obtained from Instant", e);
    } catch (UnsupportedTemporalTypeException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException("Field " + field + " is not supported for Instant", e);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while getting value for field " + field);
    }
}
```

This method now includes three catch blocks to handle the different exceptions that may be thrown by the `getLong()` method. If a `DateTimeException` is thrown, it means that a value for the specified field cannot be obtained from the `Instant` object, so we throw a new `DateTimeException` with a more descriptive error message. If an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` is thrown, it means that the specified field is not supported for the `Instant` object, so we throw a new `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` with a more descriptive error message. Finally, if an `ArithmeticException` is thrown, it means that a numeric overflow occurred while getting the value for the specified field, so we throw a new `ArithmeticException` with a more descriptive error message.

You can call this method like this:

```java
Instant instant = Instant.now();
long epochSecond = getFieldValue(instant, ChronoField.INSTANT_SECONDS);
``` 

This would get the value of the `INSTANT_SECONDS` field from the current instant and store it in the `epochSecond` variable, while also handling any potential exceptions that may occur.
