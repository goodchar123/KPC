Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for both end of stream and I/O errors:

```java
public float readFloat(DataInputStream input) throws IOException {
    if (input == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("input is null");
    }
    if (input.available() < 4) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    try {
        return input.readFloat();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        if (e.getMessage().equals("Stream closed")) {
            throw new IOException("Stream closed or input stream does not support reading after close", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the method first checks if the input stream is null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is.

Next, it checks if the number of bytes available in the input stream is less than four. If it is, then it throws an `EOFException` to indicate that the end of the stream has been reached before the four bytes required to read a float value have been read.

If there are at least four bytes available, then the method attempts to read a float value from the input stream using the `readFloat()` method. If an `IOException` is thrown, the method checks if the error message is "Stream closed". If it is, then it throws a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. Otherwise, it re-throws the original `IOException`.

Note that this version of the method should handle both end of stream and I/O errors appropriately.
