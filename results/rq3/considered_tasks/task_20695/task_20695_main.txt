Please write a java method that Retrieves a copy of the specified substring in the CLOB value designated by this Clob object.
Here's a Java method that retrieves a copy of the specified substring in the CLOB value designated by a Clob object:

```java
public String getClobSubstring(Clob clob, long pos, int length) throws SQLException {
    Reader reader = clob.getCharacterStream();
    char[] buffer = new char[length];
    reader.skip(pos - 1);
    reader.read(buffer, 0, length);
    return new String(buffer);
}
```

This method takes a Clob object, a starting position (pos), and a length as parameters. It returns a String that contains the specified substring.

The method first gets a Reader object from the Clob using the `getCharacterStream()` method. It then creates a character buffer of the specified length and skips to the starting position in the Reader using the `skip()` method. Finally, it reads the specified number of characters into the buffer using the `read()` method and returns the resulting String.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if there is an error accessing the         CLOB value for java.sql.Clob.getCharacterStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver         does not support this method for java.sql.Clob.getCharacterStream() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Please check If n is negative. for java.io.Reader.skip(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.Reader.skip(long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Please check If off is negative, or len is negative,             or len is greater than cbuf.length   off for java.io.Reader.read(char[],int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Please check If an I/O error occurs for java.io.Reader.read(char[],int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes error checking and exception handling:

```java
public String getClobSubstring(Clob clob, long pos, int length) throws SQLException, SQLFeatureNotSupportedException, IOException {
    if (clob == null) {
        throw new SQLException("Clob object is null");
    }
    if (pos < 1) {
        throw new SQLException("Invalid starting position");
    }
    if (length < 1) {
        throw new SQLException("Invalid length");
    }
    Reader reader = clob.getCharacterStream();
    if (reader == null) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("getCharacterStream() not supported by JDBC driver");
    }
    char[] buffer = new char[length];
    if (pos > reader.skip(pos - 1)) {
        throw new SQLException("Error accessing CLOB value");
    }
    int bytesRead = reader.read(buffer, 0, length);
    if (bytesRead == -1) {
        throw new SQLException("Error accessing CLOB value");
    }
    return new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
}
```

This updated method includes several checks to ensure that the input parameters are valid and that the CLOB value can be accessed without errors. 

If the Clob object is null, an SQLException is thrown. If the starting position or length is less than 1, an SQLException is thrown. If the JDBC driver does not support the `getCharacterStream()` method, a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException is thrown.

The method also checks for errors when accessing the CLOB value using the `skip()` and `read()` methods. If an error occurs, an SQLException is thrown.

Finally, the method returns the resulting String containing the specified substring.
