
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the currently running statement:

```java
public void updateAsciiStream(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, int rowId, InputStream asciiStream, int length, int timeoutSeconds) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        stmt.setAsciiStream(1, asciiStream, length);
        stmt.setInt(2, rowId);
        stmt.setQueryTimeout(timeoutSeconds);
        int updateCount = stmt.executeUpdate();
        if (updateCount == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("No rows were updated");
        }
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        // Attempt to cancel the statement if it's still running
        stmt.cancel();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `timeoutSeconds` which specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for the statement to complete before timing out. It sets the query timeout using the `setQueryTimeout()` method on the `PreparedStatement`.

After executing the update, the method checks the update count to ensure that at least one row was updated. If no rows were updated, it throws a `SQLException`.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is caught, the method attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel()` method on the `PreparedStatement`. It then re-throws the exception to indicate that the query timed out.
