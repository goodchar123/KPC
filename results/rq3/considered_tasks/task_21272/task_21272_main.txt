Please write a java method that Updates the designated column with an ascii stream value, which will have the specified number of bytes.
Here's an example Java method that updates a designated column with an ASCII stream value:

```java
public void updateAsciiStream(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, int rowId, InputStream asciiStream, int length) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        stmt.setAsciiStream(1, asciiStream, length);
        stmt.setInt(2, rowId);
        stmt.executeUpdate();
    }
}
```

This method takes in a `Connection` object, the name of the table to update, the name of the column to update, the row ID of the record to update, an `InputStream` containing the ASCII stream value, and the length of the stream in bytes.

The method constructs an SQL update statement with placeholders for the column value and row ID. It then creates a `PreparedStatement` object from the connection and sets the ASCII stream value and length using the `setAsciiStream()` method. Finally, it sets the row ID using the `setInt()` method and executes the update using the `executeUpdate()` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the setQueryTimeout method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running Statement for java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLTimeoutException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the currently running statement:

```java
public void updateAsciiStream(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, int rowId, InputStream asciiStream, int length, int timeoutSeconds) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        stmt.setAsciiStream(1, asciiStream, length);
        stmt.setInt(2, rowId);
        stmt.setQueryTimeout(timeoutSeconds);
        int updateCount = stmt.executeUpdate();
        if (updateCount == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("No rows were updated");
        }
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        // Attempt to cancel the statement if it's still running
        stmt.cancel();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `timeoutSeconds` which specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for the statement to complete before timing out. It sets the query timeout using the `setQueryTimeout()` method on the `PreparedStatement`.

After executing the update, the method checks the update count to ensure that at least one row was updated. If no rows were updated, it throws a `SQLException`.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is caught, the method attempts to cancel the statement using the `cancel()` method on the `PreparedStatement`. It then re-throws the exception to indicate that the query timed out.
