Please write a java method that Arrives at this phaser and deregisters from it without waiting for others to arrive.
Here's an example Java method that arrives at a phaser and deregisters from it without waiting for others to arrive:

```java
public void arriveAndDeregister(Phaser phaser) {
    phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

This method takes a `Phaser` object as a parameter and calls the `arriveAndDeregister()` method on it. This method causes the current thread to arrive at the phaser and deregister from it without waiting for other threads to arrive.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if not terminated and the number of registered or unarrived parties would become negative for java.util.concurrent.Phaser.arriveAndDeregister() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the phaser is not terminated and the number of registered or unarrived parties would become negative before calling `arriveAndDeregister()`. If either of these conditions is true, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown:

```java
public void arriveAndDeregister(Phaser phaser) {
    if (phaser.isTerminated() || phaser.getRegisteredParties() - phaser.getArrivedParties() <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Phaser is terminated or number of registered/unarrived parties would become negative");
    }
    phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
}
```

This method first checks if the phaser is terminated using the `isTerminated()` method. If the phaser is terminated, it means that no more parties can arrive at the phaser, so an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

Next, the method calculates the difference between the number of registered parties and the number of arrived parties using the `getRegisteredParties()` and `getArrivedParties()` methods. If this difference is less than or equal to zero, it means that the number of registered or unarrived parties would become negative if the current thread were to deregister from the phaser. In this case, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

If neither of these conditions is true, the method calls `arriveAndDeregister()` on the phaser to cause the current thread to arrive at the phaser and deregister from it without waiting for other threads to arrive.
