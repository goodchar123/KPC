Please write a java method that Writes this property list (key and element pairs) in this Properties table to the output character stream in a format suitable for using the load(Reader) method.
Here's a Java method that writes a Properties table to an output character stream in a format suitable for using the load(Reader) method:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;
import java.io.Writer;
import java.util.Properties;

public class PropertiesWriter {
    public static void writeProperties(Properties props, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
        Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(out, "UTF-8");
        props.store(writer, null);
    }
}
```

This method takes a Properties object and an OutputStream as input, and writes the properties to the output stream in the format expected by the load(Reader) method. The method uses a Writer to write the properties to the output stream, and the store() method of the Properties class to write the properties in the correct format. The second argument to the store() method is set to null, which means that no comments will be written to the output stream.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this Properties object             contains any keys or values that are not Strings. for java.util.Properties.store(java.io.Writer,java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw ClassCastException.
Please check if writer is null. for java.util.Properties.store(java.io.Writer,java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Here's the updated Java method that checks for non-String keys or values in the Properties object, and also checks for a null Writer:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.OutputStreamWriter;
import java.io.Writer;
import java.util.Properties;

public class PropertiesWriter {
    public static void writeProperties(Properties props, OutputStream out) throws IOException {
        if (props.keySet().stream().anyMatch(key -> !(key instanceof String))) {
            throw new ClassCastException("Properties object contains non-String keys");
        }
        if (props.values().stream().anyMatch(value -> !(value instanceof String))) {
            throw new ClassCastException("Properties object contains non-String values");
        }
        if (out == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Output stream is null");
        }
        Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(out, "UTF-8");
        props.store(writer, null);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the Properties object contains any non-String keys or values using the stream() method and the anyMatch() method of the Stream interface. If any non-String keys or values are found, a ClassCastException is thrown.

Next, the method checks if the output stream is null. If it is, a NullPointerException is thrown.

If both checks pass, the method proceeds to write the properties to the output stream using the same code as before.
