Please write a java method that Updates the designated column using the given input stream, which will have the specified number of bytes.
Here's an example Java method that updates a designated column using an input stream with a specified number of bytes:

```java
public void updateColumnWithStream(int column, InputStream inputStream, int numBytes) throws SQLException {
    Connection conn = null;
    PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
    try {
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
        pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("UPDATE mytable SET mycolumn = ? WHERE id = ?");
        pstmt.setBinaryStream(1, inputStream, numBytes);
        pstmt.setInt(2, 123); // replace with the actual ID of the row you want to update
        pstmt.executeUpdate();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        if (pstmt != null) {
            pstmt.close();
        }
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.close();
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes three parameters: the column number to update, an input stream containing the data to update the column with, and the number of bytes in the input stream. It uses a prepared statement to execute an update query on a table called `mytable`, setting the value of the specified column to the input stream. The `setBinaryStream` method is used to set the input stream as a parameter, and the `setInt` method is used to set the ID of the row to update. Finally, the method closes the prepared statement and connection objects to release resources.

Please check when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the setQueryTimeout method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running Statement for java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLTimeoutException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the currently running statement:

```java
public void updateColumnWithStream(int column, InputStream inputStream, int numBytes, int timeoutSeconds) throws SQLException {
    Connection conn = null;
    PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
    try {
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
        pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("UPDATE mytable SET mycolumn = ? WHERE id = ?");
        pstmt.setBinaryStream(1, inputStream, numBytes);
        pstmt.setInt(2, 123); // replace with the actual ID of the row you want to update
        pstmt.setQueryTimeout(timeoutSeconds); // set query timeout
        int rowsUpdated = pstmt.executeUpdate();
        if (rowsUpdated == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("No rows were updated");
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            // attempt to cancel the currently running statement
            if (pstmt != null) {
                pstmt.cancel();
            }
        }
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (pstmt != null) {
            pstmt.close();
        }
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.close();
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `timeoutSeconds` which specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for the query to complete before timing out. It sets the query timeout using the `setQueryTimeout` method of the prepared statement.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel` method of the prepared statement. It then re-throws the exception to be handled by the calling code.

Note that the `executeUpdate` method returns the number of rows that were updated by the query. If this value is 0, the method throws a `SQLException` with a message indicating that no rows were updated. This can be useful for detecting errors in the update query.
