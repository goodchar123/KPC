
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the currently running statement:

```java
public void updateColumnWithStream(int column, InputStream inputStream, int numBytes, int timeoutSeconds) throws SQLException {
    Connection conn = null;
    PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
    try {
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");
        pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("UPDATE mytable SET mycolumn = ? WHERE id = ?");
        pstmt.setBinaryStream(1, inputStream, numBytes);
        pstmt.setInt(2, 123); // replace with the actual ID of the row you want to update
        pstmt.setQueryTimeout(timeoutSeconds); // set query timeout
        int rowsUpdated = pstmt.executeUpdate();
        if (rowsUpdated == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("No rows were updated");
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            // attempt to cancel the currently running statement
            if (pstmt != null) {
                pstmt.cancel();
            }
        }
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (pstmt != null) {
            pstmt.close();
        }
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.close();
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `timeoutSeconds` which specifies the maximum number of seconds to wait for the query to complete before timing out. It sets the query timeout using the `setQueryTimeout` method of the prepared statement.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is thrown, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel` method of the prepared statement. It then re-throws the exception to be handled by the calling code.

Note that the `executeUpdate` method returns the number of rows that were updated by the query. If this value is 0, the method throws a `SQLException` with a message indicating that no rows were updated. This can be useful for detecting errors in the update query.
