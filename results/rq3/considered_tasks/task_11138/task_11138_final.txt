Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that includes the error handling you requested:

```java
import java.net.Socket;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.UnknownHostException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.security.Security;

public class SocketExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String host = "example.com"; // replace with your desired host
        int port = 80; // replace with your desired port

        try {
            InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName(host);
            if (address == null) {
                throw new UnknownHostException("No IP address for host could be found");
            }
            if (address instanceof java.net.Inet6Address && address.getScopeId() != 0) {
                throw new UnknownHostException("A scope_id was specified for a global IPv6 address");
            }
            SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
            if (sm != null) {
                sm.checkConnect(address.getHostAddress(), port);
            }
            Socket socket = new Socket(address, port);
            System.out.println("Connected to " + host + " on port " + port);
            // do something with the socket...
            socket.close();
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            System.err.println("Failed to connect to " + host + " on port " + port + ": " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Failed to connect to " + host + " on port " + port);
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            System.err.println("Security manager doesn't allow the operation: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This version of the code checks for two possible exceptions that can be thrown by `InetAddress.getByName()`: `UnknownHostException` if no IP address for the host could be found, or if a scope_id was specified for a global IPv6 address; and `SecurityException` if a security manager exists and its `checkConnect()` method doesn't allow the operation. If either of these exceptions is thrown, the code prints an error message and the stack trace.
