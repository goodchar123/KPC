
Sure, here's an updated version of the `updateBinaryStream` method that checks for a query timeout and attempts to cancel the currently running statement if the timeout has been exceeded:

```java
public void updateBinaryStream(Connection conn, String tableName, String columnName, InputStream binaryStream, int length, int id, int timeout) throws SQLException {
    String sql = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + columnName + " = ? WHERE id = ?";
    try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setBinaryStream(1, binaryStream, length);
        pstmt.setInt(2, id);
        pstmt.setQueryTimeout(timeout);
        int rowsUpdated = pstmt.executeUpdate();
        if (rowsUpdated == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("No rows were updated");
        }
    } catch (SQLTimeoutException e) {
        // Attempt to cancel the currently running statement
        pstmt.cancel();
        throw e;
    }
}
```

This updated method takes an additional parameter `timeout` which specifies the query timeout in seconds. The `setQueryTimeout()` method is called on the `PreparedStatement` object to set the query timeout.

After executing the update statement, the method checks if any rows were updated. If no rows were updated, it throws a `SQLException`.

If a `SQLTimeoutException` is caught, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel()` method on the `PreparedStatement` object. The exception is then re-thrown to indicate that the query timeout was exceeded.
