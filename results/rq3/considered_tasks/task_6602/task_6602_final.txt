Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the month-of-year value is valid and throws a `DateTimeException` if it is not:

```java
public YearMonth withMonth(YearMonth yearMonth, int month) {
    try {
        return yearMonth.withMonth(month);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid month value: " + month, e);
    }
}
```

This method first tries to call the `withMonth()` method on the YearMonth object, passing in the month value. If the month value is invalid, a `DateTimeException` will be thrown. In this case, the method catches the exception and throws a new `DateTimeException` with a more informative error message that includes the invalid month value. If the month value is valid, the method returns the resulting YearMonth object.

This updated method ensures that any invalid month values are caught and handled appropriately, while still returning a new YearMonth object with the desired month-of-year if the value is valid.
