Please write a java method that Returns a copy of this YearMonth with the month-of-year altered.
Here's a Java method that returns a copy of a given YearMonth object with the month-of-year altered:

```java
public YearMonth withMonth(YearMonth yearMonth, int month) {
    return yearMonth.withMonth(month);
}
```

This method takes in a YearMonth object and an integer value representing the desired month-of-year. It then calls the `withMonth()` method on the YearMonth object, passing in the month value, and returns the resulting YearMonth object. This method ensures that the original YearMonth object is not modified and a new object is returned with the desired month-of-year.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the month of year value is invalid for java.time.YearMonth.withMonth(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DateTimeException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the month-of-year value is valid and throws a `DateTimeException` if it is not:

```java
public YearMonth withMonth(YearMonth yearMonth, int month) {
    try {
        return yearMonth.withMonth(month);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Invalid month value: " + month, e);
    }
}
```

This method first tries to call the `withMonth()` method on the YearMonth object, passing in the month value. If the month value is invalid, a `DateTimeException` will be thrown. In this case, the method catches the exception and throws a new `DateTimeException` with a more informative error message that includes the invalid month value. If the month value is valid, the method returns the resulting YearMonth object.

This updated method ensures that any invalid month values are caught and handled appropriately, while still returning a new YearMonth object with the desired month-of-year if the value is valid.
