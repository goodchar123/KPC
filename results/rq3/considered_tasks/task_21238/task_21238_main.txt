Please write a java method that Retrieves whether a row has been deleted.
Here's a Java method that retrieves whether a row has been deleted:

```java
public boolean isRowDeleted(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    return rs.rowDeleted();
}
```

This method takes a `ResultSet` object as a parameter and calls the `rowDeleted()` method on it to retrieve whether the current row has been deleted. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the row has been deleted or not. If the row has been deleted, the method returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

Note that this method assumes that the `ResultSet` object is positioned on a valid row. If the `ResultSet` object is not positioned on a valid row, calling the `rowDeleted()` method will result in a `SQLException`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.rowDeleted() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Please check if the JDBC driver does not support this method for java.sql.ResultSet.rowDeleted() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors, closed result sets, and unsupported methods:

```java
public boolean isRowDeleted(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    try {
        if (rs.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
        }
        return rs.rowDeleted();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `ResultSet` object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the result set is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

Next, the method calls the `rowDeleted()` method on the `ResultSet` object to retrieve whether the current row has been deleted. If the JDBC driver does not support this method, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with an appropriate message.

If any other database access error occurs, the method throws a `SQLException` with the error message and error code obtained from the exception.

Note that this method assumes that the `ResultSet` object is positioned on a valid row. If the `ResultSet` object is not positioned on a valid row, calling the `rowDeleted()` method will result in a `SQLException`.
