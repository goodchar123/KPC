
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors, closed result sets, and unsupported methods:

```java
public boolean isRowDeleted(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
    try {
        if (rs.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Result set is closed");
        }
        return rs.rowDeleted();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if the `ResultSet` object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If the result set is closed, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message.

Next, the method calls the `rowDeleted()` method on the `ResultSet` object to retrieve whether the current row has been deleted. If the JDBC driver does not support this method, it throws a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with an appropriate message.

If any other database access error occurs, the method throws a `SQLException` with the error message and error code obtained from the exception.

Note that this method assumes that the `ResultSet` object is positioned on a valid row. If the `ResultSet` object is not positioned on a valid row, calling the `rowDeleted()` method will result in a `SQLException`.
