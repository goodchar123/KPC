Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static long getFieldValue(LocalDateTime dateTime, ChronoField field) {
    try {
        return dateTime.getLong(field);
    } catch (DateTimeException e) {
        throw new DateTimeException("Value for field " + field + " cannot be obtained from LocalDateTime", e);
    } catch (UnsupportedTemporalTypeException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException("Field " + field + " is not supported by LocalDateTime", e);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Numeric overflow occurred while getting value for field " + field);
    }
}
```

This updated method includes three catch blocks to handle the three possible exceptions that can be thrown by the `getLong()` method:

- `DateTimeException`: This is thrown if a value for the field cannot be obtained from the `LocalDateTime` object. In this case, we catch the exception and re-throw it with a more descriptive error message.
- `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`: This is thrown if the specified field is not supported by the `LocalDateTime` object. Again, we catch the exception and re-throw it with a more descriptive error message.
- `ArithmeticException`: This is thrown if a numeric overflow occurs while getting the value for the field. We catch the exception and re-throw it with a more descriptive error message.

You can call this updated method in the same way as before:

```java
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
long year = getFieldValue(dateTime, ChronoField.YEAR);
long month = getFieldValue(dateTime, ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR);
long day = getFieldValue(dateTime, ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH);
``` 

If any of the exceptions are thrown, they will be caught and re-thrown with a more descriptive error message.
