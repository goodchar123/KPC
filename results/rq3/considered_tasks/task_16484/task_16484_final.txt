Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the stamp matches the current state of the lock and throws an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if it doesn't:

```java
public void releaseLock(StampedLock lock, long stamp, LockMode mode) {
    if (lock.validate(stamp)) {
        switch (mode) {
            case READ:
                if (lock.tryUnlockRead(stamp)) {
                    break;
                }
                throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Invalid stamp for unlockRead");
            case WRITE:
                if (lock.tryUnlockWrite(stamp)) {
                    break;
                }
                throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Invalid stamp for unlockWrite");
            case OPTIMISTIC:
                if (lock.tryUnlock(stamp)) {
                    break;
                }
                throw new IllegalMonitorStateException("Invalid stamp for unlock");
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid lock mode");
        }
    }
}
```

This method now uses the `tryUnlockRead()`, `tryUnlockWrite()`, and `tryUnlock()` methods of the `StampedLock` class instead of the `unlockRead()`, `unlockWrite()`, and `unlock()` methods. These methods return a `boolean` value indicating whether the stamp matches the current state of the lock. If the stamp is invalid, the method throws an `IllegalMonitorStateException` with an appropriate error message.

Note that the `tryUnlockRead()`, `tryUnlockWrite()`, and `tryUnlock()` methods are only available in Java 8 and later. If you're using an earlier version of Java, you'll need to use the `unlockRead()`, `unlockWrite()`, and `unlock()` methods and manually check if the stamp matches the current state of the lock using the `validate()` method.
