Is the IOException handled or caught for java.net.URL.openStream() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `getAudioInputStreamFromUrl()` method, but it is not caught or handled within the method itself.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the UnsupportedAudioFileException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `UnsupportedAudioFileException` is declared to be thrown by the `getAudioInputStreamFromUrl()` method, and it is caught and declared to be thrown by the method itself.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `getAudioInputStreamFromUrl()` method, and it is caught and declared to be thrown by the method itself.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the `getAudioInputStreamFromUrl()` method. If a `NullPointerException` is thrown by the method, it will propagate up the call stack.
