Sure, here's an updated version of the `setSystemProperties` method that checks for the existence of a security manager and its `checkPropertiesAccess` method before setting the system properties:

```java
public static void setSystemProperties(Properties props) {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPropertiesAccess();
    }
    System.setProperties(props);
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager exists using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a security manager is present, it then calls its `checkPropertiesAccess()` method to check if access to the system properties is allowed. If access is not allowed, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If access is allowed, the method proceeds to set the system properties using `System.setProperties()`.
