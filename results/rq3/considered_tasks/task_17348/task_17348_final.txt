You're right, it's important to handle potential I/O errors when calling `write()`, `flush()`, and `close()` on an `OutputStream`. Here's an updated version of the method that includes error handling:

```java
public int writeBytesToBlob(Blob blob, byte[] bytes, int offset, int length) throws SQLException, IOException {
    OutputStream out = blob.setBinaryStream(offset + 1);
    try {
        out.write(bytes, offset, length);
        out.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (out != null) {
            try {
                out.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // ignore
            }
        }
    }
    return length;
}
```

This version of the method uses a try-catch-finally block to handle potential exceptions. If an `IOException` or `SQLException` is thrown while writing to the output stream, it is re-thrown to the calling method. In the `finally` block, the output stream is closed to ensure that any resources are released, even if an exception was thrown earlier. If an `IOException` is thrown while closing the stream, it is ignored since the main exception has already been thrown.
