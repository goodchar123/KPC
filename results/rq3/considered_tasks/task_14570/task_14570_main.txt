Please write a java method that Skips input that matches a pattern constructed from the specified string.
Here's an example Java method that skips input that matches a pattern constructed from the specified string:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class SkipPattern {
    public static void skipPattern(String patternString) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(patternString);

        while (scanner.hasNext()) {
            String input = scanner.next();
            if (pattern.matcher(input).matches()) {
                continue;
            }
            System.out.println(input);
        }
    }
}
```

This method takes a string `patternString` as input, which is used to construct a regular expression pattern. It then creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the console. The method reads input from the scanner in a loop, and checks whether each input matches the pattern using the `matches()` method of the `Matcher` object. If the input matches the pattern, the loop continues without printing the input. If the input does not match the pattern, the method prints the input to the console.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNext() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if no more tokens are available for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check If the expression's syntax is invalid for java.util.regex.Pattern.compile(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw PatternSyntaxException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks:

```java
import java.util.NoSuchElementException;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException;

public class SkipPattern {
    public static void skipPattern(String patternString) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Pattern pattern;
        try {
            pattern = Pattern.compile(patternString);
        } catch (PatternSyntaxException e) {
            throw new PatternSyntaxException("Invalid pattern syntax: " + e.getMessage(), e.getPattern(), e.getIndex());
        }

        while (scanner.hasNext()) {
            if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
            }
            String input;
            try {
                input = scanner.next();
            } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
                throw new NoSuchElementException("No more tokens available");
            }
            if (scanner.ioException() != null) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed");
            }
            if (pattern.matcher(input).matches()) {
                continue;
            }
            System.out.println(input);
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following checks:

- Before compiling the pattern, it checks for any syntax errors in the pattern using a try-catch block. If there is a syntax error, it throws a `PatternSyntaxException` with a message that includes the error message, the pattern, and the index where the error occurred.
- Before reading each input token, it checks whether the scanner is closed using the `ioException()` method. If the scanner is closed, it throws an `IllegalStateException` with a message indicating that the scanner is closed.
- After reading each input token, it checks whether the scanner is closed using the `ioException()` method. If the scanner is closed, it throws an `IllegalStateException` with a message indicating that the scanner is closed.
- If there are no more tokens available to read, it throws a `NoSuchElementException` with a message indicating that there are no more tokens available.
