List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)` - reads up to `len` bytes from the input stream and stores them into the byte array starting at index `off + bytesRead`.
2. `java.io.IOException` - thrown if an exception occurs during the read operation.

 + From response, we get: ['java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int)', 'java.io.IOException']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown in the method signature, which means it is being caught or handled by the calling method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not explicitly handled or caught in the code snippet. If a `NullPointerException` is thrown during the execution of the method, it will propagate up the call stack until it is caught or the program terminates.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is not explicitly handled or caught in the code snippet. If an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown during the execution of the method, it will propagate up the call stack until it is caught or the program terminates.
