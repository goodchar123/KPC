Please write a java method that Reads up to len bytes from the stream, and stores them into b starting at index off.
Here's an example Java method that reads up to len bytes from a stream and stores them into a byte array starting at index off:

```
public static void readBytes(InputStream stream, byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
    int bytesRead = 0;
    while (bytesRead < len) {
        int count = stream.read(b, off + bytesRead, len - bytesRead);
        if (count == -1) {
            break;
        }
        bytesRead += count;
    }
}
```

This method takes an `InputStream` object, a byte array `b`, an offset `off`, and a length `len` as parameters. It reads up to `len` bytes from the input stream and stores them into the byte array starting at index `off`. 

The method uses a while loop to read the bytes in chunks until it has read `len` bytes or until the end of the stream is reached. The `read()` method of the input stream is called with the byte array, the starting offset, and the number of bytes left to read. The number of bytes actually read is returned and added to the `bytesRead` variable. 

If the `read()` method returns -1, it means the end of the stream has been reached, so the loop is exited. If an exception occurs during the read operation, it is thrown as an `IOException`.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If b is null. for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check If off is negative,             len is negative, or len is greater than             b.length   off for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Here's the updated Java method that checks for null and negative values and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```
public static void readBytes(InputStream stream, byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
    if (b == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("byte array is null");
    }
    if (off < 0 || len < 0 || len > b.length - off) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("offset or length is invalid");
    }
    int bytesRead = 0;
    while (bytesRead < len) {
        int count = stream.read(b, off + bytesRead, len - bytesRead);
        if (count == -1) {
            break;
        }
        bytesRead += count;
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the byte array `b` is null. If it is, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating that the byte array is null.

Next, it checks if the offset `off` is negative, if the length `len` is negative, or if the length is greater than the remaining space in the byte array starting at the offset. If any of these conditions are true, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown with a message indicating that the offset or length is invalid.

If none of these exceptions are thrown, the method proceeds to read the bytes from the input stream and store them into the byte array as before.
