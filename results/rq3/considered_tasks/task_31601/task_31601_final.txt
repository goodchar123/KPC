
Here's the updated Java method that checks for null and negative values and throws the appropriate exceptions:

```
public static void readBytes(InputStream stream, byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
    if (b == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("byte array is null");
    }
    if (off < 0 || len < 0 || len > b.length - off) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("offset or length is invalid");
    }
    int bytesRead = 0;
    while (bytesRead < len) {
        int count = stream.read(b, off + bytesRead, len - bytesRead);
        if (count == -1) {
            break;
        }
        bytesRead += count;
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the byte array `b` is null. If it is, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating that the byte array is null.

Next, it checks if the offset `off` is negative, if the length `len` is negative, or if the length is greater than the remaining space in the byte array starting at the offset. If any of these conditions are true, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown with a message indicating that the offset or length is invalid.

If none of these exceptions are thrown, the method proceeds to read the bytes from the input stream and store them into the byte array as before.
