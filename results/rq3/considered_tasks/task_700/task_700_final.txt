Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if the connection ID cannot be obtained and throws an `IOException` in that case:

```java
import javax.management.remote.JMXConnector;
import java.io.IOException;

public String getConnectionId(JMXConnector connector) throws IOException {
    try {
        return connector.getConnectionId();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        throw new IOException("Failed to get connection ID", e);
    }
}
```

This method takes a `JMXConnector` object as input and returns a `String` representing the connection ID. It calls the `getConnectionId()` method on the `JMXConnector` object to retrieve the connection ID. If an `IOException` occurs, it is thrown immediately. If any other exception occurs, it prints the stack trace and throws a new `IOException` with a message indicating that the connection ID could not be obtained.
