Here's the updated Java method that checks for the three conditions you mentioned:

```java
public static String replaceFirstMatch(String input, Pattern pattern, Function<MatchResult, String> replacer) {
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
    if (matcher.find()) {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        try {
            matcher.appendReplacement(sb, replacer.apply(matcher.toMatchResult()));
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("No match has yet been attempted, or the previous match operation failed.", e);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The replacement string refers to a named capturing group that does not exist in the pattern.", e);
        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("The replacement string refers to a capturing group that does not exist in the pattern.", e);
        }
        matcher.appendTail(sb);
        return sb.toString();
    }
    return input;
}
```

This updated method adds a `try-catch` block around the call to `matcher.appendReplacement(sb, replacer.apply(matcher.toMatchResult()))`. Inside the `try` block, it catches three possible exceptions:

- `IllegalStateException`: if no match has yet been attempted, or if the previous match operation failed
- `IllegalArgumentException`: if the replacement string refers to a named capturing group that does not exist in the pattern
- `IndexOutOfBoundsException`: if the replacement string refers to a capturing group that does not exist in the pattern

If any of these exceptions are caught, the method throws a new exception with a more descriptive error message and the original exception as the cause.

This updated method should help catch any errors that may occur during the replacement process and provide more helpful error messages to the caller.
