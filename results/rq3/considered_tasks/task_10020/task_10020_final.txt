Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error while flushing the stream and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public void flushStream(OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        outputStream.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error flushing stream", e);
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur while flushing the stream. If an `IOException` is caught, it is re-thrown with a custom error message indicating that an error occurred while flushing the stream.
