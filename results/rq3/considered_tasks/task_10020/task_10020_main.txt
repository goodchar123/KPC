Please write a java method that Flushes this stream by writing any buffered output to the underlying stream.
Here's a Java method that flushes a stream by writing any buffered output to the underlying stream:

```java
public void flushStream(OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    outputStream.flush();
}
```

This method takes an `OutputStream` as a parameter and calls the `flush()` method on it to write any buffered output to the underlying stream. It also throws an `IOException` if there is an error while flushing the stream.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if an I/O error occurs. for java.io.OutputStream.flush() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IOException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for an I/O error while flushing the stream and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public void flushStream(OutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {
    try {
        outputStream.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error flushing stream", e);
    }
}
```

This method uses a try-catch block to catch any `IOException` that may occur while flushing the stream. If an `IOException` is caught, it is re-thrown with a custom error message indicating that an error occurred while flushing the stream.
