
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks for a database access error or a closed connection before calling `createStatement()`, and throws a `SQLException` if either condition is met:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class DBMSConnection {
    public static Statement createStatement(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
        if (conn == null || conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        Statement stmt = null;
        try {
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
        }
        return stmt;
    }
}
```

This method takes in a `Connection` object as a parameter and returns a `Statement` object. It first checks if the connection is null or closed, and throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message if either condition is met. If the connection is valid, it attempts to create a new `Statement` object and returns it. If a database access error occurs during the creation of the statement, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message and the original exception as the cause.
