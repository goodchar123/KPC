Please write a java method that Retrieves the URL for this DBMS.
Assuming you are referring to the URL for a JDBC connection to a DBMS, here is an example Java method that retrieves the URL:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class DBMSConnection {
    public static String getDBMSURL(String host, String port, String database) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://" + host + ":" + port + "/" + database;
        return url;
    }
}
```

This method takes in three parameters: `host`, `port`, and `database`. It then constructs a URL string for a MySQL database using these parameters and returns the URL. You can modify this method to work with other DBMSs by changing the URL format accordingly.

Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed connection for java.sql.Connection.createStatement() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the code snippet that checks for a database access error or a closed connection before calling `createStatement()`, and throws a `SQLException` if either condition is met:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class DBMSConnection {
    public static Statement createStatement(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
        if (conn == null || conn.isClosed()) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
        }
        Statement stmt = null;
        try {
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error", e);
        }
        return stmt;
    }
}
```

This method takes in a `Connection` object as a parameter and returns a `Statement` object. It first checks if the connection is null or closed, and throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message if either condition is met. If the connection is valid, it attempts to create a new `Statement` object and returns it. If a database access error occurs during the creation of the statement, it throws a `SQLException` with an appropriate message and the original exception as the cause.
