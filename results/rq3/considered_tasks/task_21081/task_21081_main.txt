Please write a java method that Indicates whether updates made to a LOB are made on a copy or directly to the LOB.
Here's a Java method that can be used to determine whether updates made to a LOB are made on a copy or directly to the LOB:

```java
public boolean isLOBUpdatedOnCopy(Connection conn, String tableName, String lobColumnName, String primaryKeyColumn, Object primaryKeyValue) throws SQLException {
    boolean isUpdatedOnCopy = false;
    PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT " + lobColumnName + " FROM " + tableName + " WHERE " + primaryKeyColumn + " = ?");
        pstmt.setObject(1, primaryKeyValue);
        rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
        if (rs.next()) {
            Blob lob = rs.getBlob(lobColumnName);
            if (lob != null) {
                isUpdatedOnCopy = lob.isWritable();
            }
        }
    } finally {
        if (rs != null) {
            rs.close();
        }
        if (pstmt != null) {
            pstmt.close();
        }
    }
    return isUpdatedOnCopy;
}
```

This method takes in a `Connection` object, the name of the table containing the LOB, the name of the LOB column, the name of the primary key column, and the value of the primary key for the row containing the LOB. It returns a boolean value indicating whether updates made to the LOB are made on a copy or directly to the LOB.

The method first creates a `PreparedStatement` object to select the row containing the LOB using the primary key value. It then executes the query and retrieves the LOB using the `getBlob()` method. If the LOB is not null, it checks whether it is writable using the `isWritable()` method. If the LOB is writable, it means that updates are made directly to the LOB. If the LOB is not writable, it means that updates are made on a copy of the LOB.

Finally, the method closes the `ResultSet` and `PreparedStatement` objects and returns the boolean value indicating whether updates are made on a copy or directly to the LOB.

Please check when the driver has determined that the timeout value that was specified by the setQueryTimeout method has been exceeded and has at least attempted to cancel the currently running Statement for java.sql.PreparedStatement.executeQuery() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLTimeoutException.
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is         called on a closed result set for java.sql.ResultSet.next() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error handling:

```java
public boolean isLOBUpdatedOnCopy(Connection conn, String tableName, String lobColumnName, String primaryKeyColumn, Object primaryKeyValue, int queryTimeout) throws SQLException {
    boolean isUpdatedOnCopy = false;
    PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT " + lobColumnName + " FROM " + tableName + " WHERE " + primaryKeyColumn + " = ?");
        pstmt.setObject(1, primaryKeyValue);
        pstmt.setQueryTimeout(queryTimeout);
        rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
        while (rs.next()) {
            Blob lob = rs.getBlob(lobColumnName);
            if (lob != null) {
                isUpdatedOnCopy = lob.isWritable();
            }
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            pstmt.cancel();
        }
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (rs != null) {
            try {
                rs.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw e;
            }
        }
        if (pstmt != null) {
            try {
                pstmt.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
    return isUpdatedOnCopy;
}
```

This updated method includes a `queryTimeout` parameter that specifies the maximum number of seconds that the `executeQuery()` method should wait for the query to complete before timing out. If the timeout value is exceeded, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel()` method of the `PreparedStatement` object.

In the `try` block, the `setQueryTimeout()` method is called on the `PreparedStatement` object to set the query timeout value. The `executeQuery()` method is then called to execute the query and retrieve the result set. The `while` loop is used to iterate through the result set and retrieve the LOB value for each row. If the LOB is not null, the `isWritable()` method is called to determine whether updates are made on a copy or directly to the LOB.

In the `catch` block, the method checks whether the exception thrown is an instance of `SQLTimeoutException`. If it is, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel()` method of the `PreparedStatement` object. The exception is then re-thrown.

In the `finally` block, the method closes the `ResultSet` and `PreparedStatement` objects. If a database access error occurs or the method is called on a closed result set, a `SQLException` is thrown.
