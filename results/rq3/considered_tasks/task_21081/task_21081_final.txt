
Here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error handling:

```java
public boolean isLOBUpdatedOnCopy(Connection conn, String tableName, String lobColumnName, String primaryKeyColumn, Object primaryKeyValue, int queryTimeout) throws SQLException {
    boolean isUpdatedOnCopy = false;
    PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT " + lobColumnName + " FROM " + tableName + " WHERE " + primaryKeyColumn + " = ?");
        pstmt.setObject(1, primaryKeyValue);
        pstmt.setQueryTimeout(queryTimeout);
        rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
        while (rs.next()) {
            Blob lob = rs.getBlob(lobColumnName);
            if (lob != null) {
                isUpdatedOnCopy = lob.isWritable();
            }
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e instanceof SQLTimeoutException) {
            pstmt.cancel();
        }
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (rs != null) {
            try {
                rs.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw e;
            }
        }
        if (pstmt != null) {
            try {
                pstmt.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw e;
            }
        }
    }
    return isUpdatedOnCopy;
}
```

This updated method includes a `queryTimeout` parameter that specifies the maximum number of seconds that the `executeQuery()` method should wait for the query to complete before timing out. If the timeout value is exceeded, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel()` method of the `PreparedStatement` object.

In the `try` block, the `setQueryTimeout()` method is called on the `PreparedStatement` object to set the query timeout value. The `executeQuery()` method is then called to execute the query and retrieve the result set. The `while` loop is used to iterate through the result set and retrieve the LOB value for each row. If the LOB is not null, the `isWritable()` method is called to determine whether updates are made on a copy or directly to the LOB.

In the `catch` block, the method checks whether the exception thrown is an instance of `SQLTimeoutException`. If it is, the method attempts to cancel the currently running statement using the `cancel()` method of the `PreparedStatement` object. The exception is then re-thrown.

In the `finally` block, the method closes the `ResultSet` and `PreparedStatement` objects. If a database access error occurs or the method is called on a closed result set, a `SQLException` is thrown.
