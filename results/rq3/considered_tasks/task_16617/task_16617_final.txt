Sure, here's the updated code snippet that includes the requested checks:

```java
public static TrustManager[] getTrustManagers(KeyStore trustStore, TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, KeyStoreException {
    if (trustManagerFactory == null || trustStore == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("TrustManagerFactory or TrustStore is not initialized");
    }
    trustManagerFactory.init(trustStore);
    TrustManager[] trustManagers = trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers();
    List<TrustManager> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (TrustManager trustManager : trustManagers) {
        if (trustManager instanceof X509TrustManager) {
            result.add(trustManager);
        }
    }
    try {
        return result.toArray(new TrustManager[result.size()]);
    } catch (ArrayStoreException e) {
        throw new ArrayStoreException("The runtime type of the specified array is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in this list");
    } catch (NullPointerException e) {
        throw new NullPointerException("The specified array is null");
    }
}
```

This updated method checks if the `TrustManagerFactory` and `TrustStore` are initialized before proceeding with the method. It also includes try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions that may occur when converting the list to an array. If any of these checks fail, the method throws the appropriate exception with a descriptive message.
