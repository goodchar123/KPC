Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` thrown by `in.read(byte[], int, int)` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature as a checked exception that can be thrown by the method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` thrown by `in.read(byte[], int, int)` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature as a unchecked exception that can be thrown by the method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` thrown by `in.read(byte[], int, int)` is not caught or handled in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature as a unchecked exception that can be thrown by the method.

------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `read` method, but it is not caught or handled within the method itself. It is up to the calling code to handle the exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is checked for and thrown explicitly within the `read` method, but it is not caught or handled within the method itself. It is up to the calling code to handle the exception.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is checked for and thrown explicitly within the `read` method.

List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(Object, String)`
2. `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)`

 + From response, we get: ['java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(Object,String)', 'java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `read` method in the method signature: `public int read(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException`. This means that any `IOException` thrown by the `read` method will be propagated up to the calling method, where it can be handled or caught.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is declared to be thrown by the `Objects.requireNonNull` method, but it will be propagated up to the calling method if it occurs.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is thrown explicitly by the `read` method if the `off` or `len` parameters are out of bounds, and it will be propagated up to the calling method if it occurs.
