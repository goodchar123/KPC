Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the `clear()` operation is supported by the list and throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` if it's not:

```java
public static void removeAllElements(List list) {
    try {
        list.clear();
    } catch (UnsupportedOperationException e) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("This list does not support the clear() operation.");
    }
}
```

This method simply calls the `clear()` method on the list and catches any `UnsupportedOperationException` that may be thrown. If the exception is caught, it throws a new `UnsupportedOperationException` with a message indicating that the `clear()` operation is not supported by the list.
