Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for an I/O error and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import com.sun.tools.attach.VirtualMachine;

public static void detachFromVM() throws IOException {
    VirtualMachine vm = null;
    try {
        vm = VirtualMachine.attach(String.valueOf(VirtualMachine.list().get(0).id()));
        vm.detach();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw e;
    } finally {
        if (vm != null) {
            try {
                vm.detach();
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // ignore
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code uses a try-catch-finally block to catch any `IOException` that occurs during the `detach()` method call and re-throw it as an `IOException`. The `finally` block ensures that the `detach()` method is called again to ensure that the virtual machine is properly detached, even if an exception is thrown during the first call.
