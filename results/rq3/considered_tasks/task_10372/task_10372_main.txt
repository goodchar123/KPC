Please write a java method that Reads a password or passphrase from the console with echoing disabled
Sure, here's a Java method that reads a password or passphrase from the console with echoing disabled:

```java
import java.io.Console;

public class PasswordReader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Console console = System.console();
        if (console == null) {
            System.err.println("No console.");
            System.exit(1);
        }
        char[] password = console.readPassword("Enter password: ");
        System.out.println("Password entered: " + new String(password));
    }
}
```

This method uses the `Console` class to read the password or passphrase from the console with echoing disabled. The `readPassword` method of the `Console` class reads a password or passphrase from the console with echoing disabled and returns it as a character array. The `println` method of the `System` class is used to print the password or passphrase entered by the user.

Please check if a security manager exists and its checkExit        method doesn't allow exit with the specified status. for java.lang.System.exit(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if a security manager exists and its `checkExit` method doesn't allow exit with the specified status for `java.lang.System.exit(int)`:

```java
import java.io.Console;
import java.security.Permission;

public class PasswordReader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Console console = System.console();
        if (console == null) {
            System.err.println("No console.");
            System.exit(1);
        }
        char[] password = console.readPassword("Enter password: ");
        System.out.println("Password entered: " + new String(password));
        
        SecurityManager securityManager = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (securityManager != null) {
            try {
                securityManager.checkExit(0);
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("System exit not allowed with status 0", e);
            }
        }
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists using the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a security manager exists, it then calls its `checkExit` method with a status of 0 to check if exit with the specified status is allowed. If the `checkExit` method throws a `SecurityException`, it throws a new `SecurityException` with a message indicating that system exit is not allowed with status 0. If there is no security manager or the `checkExit` method allows exit with the specified status, the method calls `System.exit(0)` to exit the program with a status of 0.
