Sure, here's an updated version of the `bindSocket()` method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public void bindSocket(DatagramSocket socket, InetAddress address, int port) throws SocketException, SecurityException, IllegalArgumentException {
    try {
        socket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(address, port));
    } catch (SocketException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw e;
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        throw e;
    }
    
    // Check if the socket is already bound
    if (!socket.isBound()) {
        throw new SocketException("Socket is not bound");
    }
    
    // Check if a security manager exists and its checkListen method doesn't allow the operation
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        try {
            security.checkListen(port);
        } catch (SecurityException e) {
            throw e;
        }
    }
    
    // Check if addr is a SocketAddress subclass not supported by this socket
    if (!(address instanceof Inet4Address) && !(address instanceof Inet6Address)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported address type");
    }
}
```

This updated method first tries to bind the socket to the specified address and port, and catches any exceptions that may be thrown. It then checks if the socket is already bound, and throws a `SocketException` if it is not.

Next, it checks if a security manager exists and its `checkListen()` method allows the operation. If a security manager exists and does not allow the operation, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

Finally, it checks if the address is a `SocketAddress` subclass that is supported by the socket (in this case, either `Inet4Address` or `Inet6Address`). If the address is not supported, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
