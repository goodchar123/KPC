
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for an I/O error and throws an `IOException` if one occurs:

```java
public void writeToSQLStream(Object obj, SQLData data) throws SQLException, IOException {
    try {
        // Convert the object to its SQL value
        data.writeSQL(stream);

        // Write the SQL value to the data stream
        stream.flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // If an I/O error occurs, throw an IOException
        throw new IOException("Error writing to SQL data stream", e);
    }
}
```

In this updated version, the `flush` method is called inside a try-catch block. If an `IOException` is thrown, it is caught and re-thrown as a new `IOException` with a more descriptive error message. This way, the caller of the method can handle the exception appropriately.
