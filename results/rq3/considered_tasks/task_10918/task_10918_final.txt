Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks for these exceptions:

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.nio.*;
import java.nio.channels.*;

public void sendDatagram(DatagramChannel channel, String message, InetSocketAddress address) throws IOException {
    // Check if the channel is closed
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }

    // Check if the remote address is not fully resolved
    if (address.isUnresolved()) {
        throw new UnresolvedAddressException();
    }

    // Check if the type of the remote address is not supported
    if (address.getAddress().getClass() != Inet4Address.class && address.getAddress().getClass() != Inet6Address.class) {
        throw new UnsupportedAddressTypeException();
    }

    // Check if a security manager denies the operation
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        if (channel.socket().isBound()) {
            sm.checkConnect(address.getAddress().getHostAddress(), address.getPort());
        } else {
            sm.checkListen(address.getPort());
        }
    }

    // Check if the channel is connected to a different address
    SocketAddress remoteAddress = channel.getRemoteAddress();
    if (remoteAddress != null && !remoteAddress.equals(address)) {
        throw new AlreadyConnectedException();
    }

    // Check if the channel is closed
    if (!channel.isOpen()) {
        throw new ClosedChannelException();
    }

    // Check if another thread closes the channel while the read operation is in progress
    if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
        channel.close();
        throw new ClosedByInterruptException();
    }

    // Convert the message to a byte array
    byte[] messageBytes = message.getBytes();

    // Create a buffer to hold the message bytes
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(messageBytes);

    try {
        // Send the datagram via the channel
        channel.send(buffer, address);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Check if some other I/O error occurs
        if (channel.isOpen()) {
            throw e;
        } else {
            throw new AsynchronousCloseException();
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method checks for the following exceptions:

- `ClosedChannelException`: If the channel is closed.
- `UnresolvedAddressException`: If the given remote address is not fully resolved.
- `UnsupportedAddressTypeException`: If the type of the given remote address is not supported.
- `SecurityException`: If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit datagrams to be sent to the given address, or if unbound, and the security manager's `checkListen` method denies the operation.
- `AlreadyConnectedException`: If the channel is already connected to a different address than the one specified in the `address` parameter.
- `ClosedByInterruptException`: If another thread interrupts the current thread while the read operation is in progress, thereby closing the channel and setting the current thread's interrupt status.
- `IOException`: If some other I/O error occurs.

Note that these exceptions are checked before and after sending the datagram via the channel. If any of these exceptions are thrown, the method will not send the datagram and will instead throw the appropriate exception.
