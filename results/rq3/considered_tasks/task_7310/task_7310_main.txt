Please write a java method that Terminates the currently running Java virtual machine by initiating its shutdown sequence.
Sure, here's an example Java method that terminates the currently running Java virtual machine:

```java
public static void terminateVM() {
    Runtime.getRuntime().exit(0);
}
```

This method uses the `Runtime` class to initiate the shutdown sequence of the Java virtual machine. The `exit()` method of the `Runtime` class is called with a status code of 0, which indicates a normal termination of the JVM. 

You can call this method from your Java code to terminate the JVM whenever you need to.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check If a security manager is present and its         checkExit method does not permit         exiting with the specified status for java.lang.Runtime.exit(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the `terminateVM()` method that checks for the presence of a security manager and its `checkExit()` method before calling `exit()`:

```java
public static void terminateVM() {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkExit(0);
    }
    Runtime.getRuntime().exit(0);
}
```

This version of the method first checks if a security manager is present by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, it then calls its `checkExit()` method with a status code of 0 to check if exiting with that status is permitted. If the security manager does not permit exiting with the specified status, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If no security manager is present or if the security manager permits exiting with the specified status, the method calls `exit()` to initiate the shutdown sequence of the JVM.

This updated version of the method provides an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized termination of the JVM.
