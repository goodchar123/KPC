Sure, here's an updated version of the `terminateVM()` method that checks for the presence of a security manager and its `checkExit()` method before calling `exit()`:

```java
public static void terminateVM() {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkExit(0);
    }
    Runtime.getRuntime().exit(0);
}
```

This version of the method first checks if a security manager is present by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager is present, it then calls its `checkExit()` method with a status code of 0 to check if exiting with that status is permitted. If the security manager does not permit exiting with the specified status, a `SecurityException` is thrown. If no security manager is present or if the security manager permits exiting with the specified status, the method calls `exit()` to initiate the shutdown sequence of the JVM.

This updated version of the method provides an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized termination of the JVM.
