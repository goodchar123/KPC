Please write a java method that Loads the native library specified by the filename argument.
Here's a Java method that loads a native library specified by the filename argument:

```java
public static void loadNativeLibrary(String filename) {
    try {
        System.loadLibrary(filename);
        System.out.println("Native library " + filename + " loaded successfully.");
    } catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {
        System.err.println("Failed to load native library " + filename + ": " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method uses the `System.loadLibrary()` method to load the native library specified by the `filename` argument. If the library is loaded successfully, it prints a message to the console. If there is an error loading the library, it prints an error message to the console.

Please check if a security manager exists and its             checkLink method doesn't allow             loading of the specified dynamic library for java.lang.System.loadLibrary(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check if libname is null for java.lang.System.loadLibrary(java.lang.String) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Here's the updated Java method that checks for a security manager and null libname before loading the native library:

```java
public static void loadNativeLibrary(String libname) throws SecurityException, NullPointerException {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkLink(libname);
    }
    if (libname == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("libname is null");
    }
    try {
        System.loadLibrary(libname);
        System.out.println("Native library " + libname + " loaded successfully.");
    } catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Failed to load native library " + libname + ": " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists and if it does, it calls the `checkLink()` method to ensure that loading the specified dynamic library is allowed. If the `libname` argument is null, it throws a `NullPointerException`.

If the security check and null check pass, the method attempts to load the native library using `System.loadLibrary()`. If there is an error loading the library, it throws a `SecurityException` with an error message. If the library is loaded successfully, it prints a message to the console.
