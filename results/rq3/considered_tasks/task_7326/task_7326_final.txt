Here's the updated Java method that checks for a security manager and null libname before loading the native library:

```java
public static void loadNativeLibrary(String libname) throws SecurityException, NullPointerException {
    SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (security != null) {
        security.checkLink(libname);
    }
    if (libname == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("libname is null");
    }
    try {
        System.loadLibrary(libname);
        System.out.println("Native library " + libname + " loaded successfully.");
    } catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Failed to load native library " + libname + ": " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This updated method first checks if a security manager exists and if it does, it calls the `checkLink()` method to ensure that loading the specified dynamic library is allowed. If the `libname` argument is null, it throws a `NullPointerException`.

If the security check and null check pass, the method attempts to load the native library using `System.loadLibrary()`. If there is an error loading the library, it throws a `SecurityException` with an error message. If the library is loaded successfully, it prints a message to the console.
