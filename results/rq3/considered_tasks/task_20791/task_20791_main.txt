Please write a java method that Retrieves the maximum number of rows that a ResultSet object produced by this Statement object can contain.
Here's the Java method to retrieve the maximum number of rows that a ResultSet object produced by a Statement object can contain:

```java
public int getMaxRows(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    return stmt.getMaxRows();
}
```

This method takes a Statement object as a parameter and returns an integer value representing the maximum number of rows that a ResultSet object produced by the Statement object can contain. It throws a SQLException if there is an error retrieving the maximum number of rows.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed Statement for java.sql.Statement.getMaxRows() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SQLException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for a database access error or a closed Statement object before retrieving the maximum number of rows:

```java
public int getMaxRows(Statement stmt) throws SQLException {
    if (stmt.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("Statement is closed.");
    }
    try {
        return stmt.getMaxRows();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new SQLException("Error retrieving maximum number of rows: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the Statement object is closed using the `isClosed()` method. If it is closed, it throws a SQLException with an appropriate message.

If the Statement object is not closed, it tries to retrieve the maximum number of rows using the `getMaxRows()` method. If there is an error, it throws a SQLException with an error message that includes the original exception message.
