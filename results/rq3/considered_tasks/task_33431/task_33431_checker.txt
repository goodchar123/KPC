Is the UnsupportedAudioFileException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `UnsupportedAudioFileException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is handled or caught in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature with the `throws` keyword, indicating that it is a checked exception that must be handled by the caller or caught within the method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. If the `inputStream` parameter is `null`, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown by the `AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream()` method.

The fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the `AudioFormatHelper` class are:

- `javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream)`
- `javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioFileFormat(javax.sound.sampled.AudioInputStream)`

 + From response, we get: ['AudioFormatHelper', 'javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream)', 'javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioFileFormat(javax.sound.sampled.AudioInputStream)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the UnsupportedAudioFileException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `UnsupportedAudioFileException` is not handled or caught for `javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream)` in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature as a checked exception that can be thrown by the method, but it is not explicitly caught or handled within the method. Instead, it is propagated up to the calling method, which must handle or declare it as well.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IOException` is not handled or caught for `javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream)` in the code snippet. It is declared in the method signature as a checked exception that can be thrown by the method, but it is not explicitly caught or handled within the method. Instead, it is propagated up to the calling method, which must handle or declare it as well.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `NullPointerException` is handled and caught for `javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(java.io.InputStream)` in the code snippet. It is explicitly checked for in the method using an `if` statement, and if it is thrown, a new `NullPointerException` with a custom error message is thrown instead. This ensures that the exception is caught and handled within the method, rather than being propagated up to the calling method.
