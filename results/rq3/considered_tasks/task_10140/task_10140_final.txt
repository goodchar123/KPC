You are correct, it is important to handle potential exceptions and errors when using the `DataInputStream` methods. Here's an updated version of the method that includes error handling:

```java
public static String readModifiedUTF8String(DataInputStream input) throws IOException {
    // Check if the input stream has reached the end before reading two bytes
    if (input.available() < 2) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    int length = input.readUnsignedShort();
    // Check if the input stream has reached the end before reading all the bytes
    if (input.available() < length) {
        throw new EOFException();
    }
    byte[] bytes = new byte[length];
    // Check if the byte array is null
    if (bytes == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException();
    }
    input.readFully(bytes);
    return new String(bytes, "UTF-8");
}
```

This updated method checks for potential exceptions and errors before reading in the string. It checks if the input stream has reached the end before reading two bytes or all the bytes, and throws an `EOFException` if it has. It also checks if the byte array is null and throws a `NullPointerException` if it is. Additionally, it checks if the input stream has been closed or if another I/O error occurs and throws an `IOException` if it
