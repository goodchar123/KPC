You are correct, the `read` method I provided does not include these checks. Here is an updated version of the method that includes these checks:

```
/**
 * Reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes.
 * An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read.
 * The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.
 * 
 * @param b the buffer into which the data is read
 * @param off the start offset in the destination array b
 * @param len the maximum number of bytes to read
 * @return the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached
 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs while reading from the input stream
 * @throws NullPointerException if b is null
 * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if off is negative, len is negative, or len is greater than b.length - off
 */
public int read(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {
    Objects.requireNonNull(b, "byte array cannot be null");
    if (off < 0 || len < 0 || len > b.length - off) {
        throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
    }
    int n = 0;
    while (n < len) {
        int count = in.read(b, off + n, len - n);
        if (count < 0) {
            break;
        }
        n += count;
    }
    return (n > 0 || len == 0) ? n : -1;
}
```

This updated method checks for the conditions you mentioned and throws the appropriate exceptions if any of them are violated.
