------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is thrown by the `Objects.requireNonNull` method, but it is not caught or handled within the `readFully` method.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is thrown by the `read` method of the `InputStream` class, but it is not caught or handled within the `readFully` method.

List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
1. `java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(Object, String)`
2. `java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)`

 + From response, we get: ['java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(Object,String)', 'java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IOException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IOException` is declared to be thrown by the `read` method, which means that it must be either handled or declared to be thrown by any method that calls it. In this case, the `IOException` is not caught within the `read` method itself, but is instead declared to be thrown by the method signature.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `NullPointerException` is handled in the code snippet. The `Objects.requireNonNull` method is called to check if the `byte[]` parameter is `null`, and if it is, a `NullPointerException` is thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IndexOutOfBoundsException handled or caught for java.io.InputStream.read(byte[],int,int) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is handled in the code snippet. The method checks if the `off` and `len` parameters are within the bounds of the `byte[]` array, and if they are not, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown.
