Please write a java method that Returns true if the next token in this scanner's input can be interpreted as a long value in the default radix using the nextLong() method.
Here's the Java method that returns true if the next token in the scanner's input can be interpreted as a long value in the default radix using the nextLong() method:

```java
public static boolean hasNextLong(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner.hasNextLong()) {
        scanner.nextLong();
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

This method takes a Scanner object as an argument and checks if the next token in the input can be interpreted as a long value using the hasNextLong() method. If it can, the method calls the nextLong() method to consume the token and returns true. If it cannot, the method simply returns false.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.hasNextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if the next token does not match the Integer         regular expression, or is out of range for java.util.Scanner.nextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InputMismatchException.
Please check if input is exhausted for java.util.Scanner.nextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NoSuchElementException.
Please check if this scanner is closed for java.util.Scanner.nextLong() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks and exceptions:

```java
public static boolean hasNextLong(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Scanner cannot be null");
    }
    if (scanner.hasNextLong()) {
        try {
            scanner.nextLong();
            return true;
        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
            throw new InputMismatchException("Next token does not match the Long regular expression, or is out of range for nextLong()");
        } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
            throw new NoSuchElementException("Input is exhausted for nextLong()");
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed for nextLong()");
        }
    } else {
        throw new InputMismatchException("Next token does not match the Long regular expression, or is out of range for nextLong()");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the scanner object is null and throws a NullPointerException if it is. Then, it checks if the next token in the input can be interpreted as a long value using the hasNextLong() method. If it can, the method calls the nextLong() method to consume the token and returns true. However, if the next token does not match the Long regular expression or is out of range for nextLong(), the method throws an InputMismatchException. If the input is exhausted, the method throws a NoSuchElementException. Finally, if the scanner is closed, the method throws an IllegalStateException.
