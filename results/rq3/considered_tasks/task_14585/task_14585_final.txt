Here's the updated Java method that includes the requested checks and exceptions:

```java
public static boolean hasNextLong(Scanner scanner) {
    if (scanner == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Scanner cannot be null");
    }
    if (scanner.hasNextLong()) {
        try {
            scanner.nextLong();
            return true;
        } catch (InputMismatchException e) {
            throw new InputMismatchException("Next token does not match the Long regular expression, or is out of range for nextLong()");
        } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
            throw new NoSuchElementException("Input is exhausted for nextLong()");
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Scanner is closed for nextLong()");
        }
    } else {
        throw new InputMismatchException("Next token does not match the Long regular expression, or is out of range for nextLong()");
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the scanner object is null and throws a NullPointerException if it is. Then, it checks if the next token in the input can be interpreted as a long value using the hasNextLong() method. If it can, the method calls the nextLong() method to consume the token and returns true. However, if the next token does not match the Long regular expression or is out of range for nextLong(), the method throws an InputMismatchException. If the input is exhausted, the method throws a NoSuchElementException. Finally, if the scanner is closed, the method throws an IllegalStateException.
