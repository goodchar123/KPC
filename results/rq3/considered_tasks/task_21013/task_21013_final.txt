
Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks for both a database access error or a closed connection when retrieving the `DatabaseMetaData` object, and also checks for a database access error when retrieving the maximum number of columns allowed in an ORDER BY clause:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class DatabaseHelper {
    public int getMaxOrderByColumns(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
        int maxColumns = 0;
        try {
            if (conn.isClosed()) {
                throw new SQLException("Connection is closed");
            }
            DatabaseMetaData metaData = conn.getMetaData();
            try {
                maxColumns = metaData.getMaxColumnsInOrderBy();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred while retrieving max columns in ORDER BY clause", e);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred while retrieving database metadata", e);
        }
        return maxColumns;
    }
}
```

This updated method now includes two try-catch blocks. The outer try-catch block attempts to retrieve the `DatabaseMetaData` object using the `getMetaData()` method of the `Connection` object. If a `SQLException` is thrown during this process, the catch block catches the exception, creates a new `SQLException` with a custom error message, and re-throws the exception with the original exception as the cause.

The inner try-catch block attempts to retrieve the maximum number of columns allowed in an ORDER BY clause using the `getMaxColumnsInOrderBy()` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` object. If a `SQLException` is thrown during this process, the catch block catches the exception, creates a new `SQLException` with a custom error message, and re-throws the exception with the original exception as the cause. This way, the calling method can handle the exception appropriately.
