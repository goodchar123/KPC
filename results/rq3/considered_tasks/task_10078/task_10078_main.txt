Please write a java method that Enables the stream to do replacement of objects read from the stream.
Here's an example Java method that enables the stream to do replacement of objects read from the stream:

```java
public void enableObjectReplacement(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    in.enableResolveObject(true);
}
```

This method takes an `ObjectInputStream` as input and enables the replacement of objects read from the stream by calling the `enableResolveObject` method with a `true` parameter. This allows the stream to replace objects with other objects during deserialization.

Note that in order for this to work, the objects being deserialized must implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface and define a `readResolve` method that returns the replacement object.

Please check if a security manager exists and its          checkPermission method denies enabling the stream          to do replacement of objects read from the stream. for java.io.ObjectInputStream.enableResolveObject(boolean) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Here's an updated version of the Java method that checks if a security manager exists and its `checkPermission` method denies enabling the stream to do replacement of objects read from the stream:

```java
public void enableObjectReplacement(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException, SecurityException {
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        sm.checkPermission(new SerializablePermission("enableSubstitution"));
    }
    in.enableResolveObject(true);
}
```

This method first checks if a security manager exists by calling `System.getSecurityManager()`. If a security manager exists, it then calls its `checkPermission` method with a `SerializablePermission` object that represents the permission to enable object substitution. If the permission is denied, a `SecurityException` is thrown.

If the permission is granted or there is no security manager, the method calls `enableResolveObject` on the `ObjectInputStream` to enable object substitution.
