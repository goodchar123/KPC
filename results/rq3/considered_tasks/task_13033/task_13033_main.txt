Please write a java method that Builds the stream, transitioning this builder to the built state.
Here's an example Java method that builds a stream:

```
public Stream<String> buildStream(List<String> list) {
    Stream.Builder<String> builder = Stream.builder();
    for (String s : list) {
        builder.add(s);
    }
    return builder.build();
}
```

This method takes a list of strings as input and builds a stream of strings using a `Stream.Builder`. The `add` method is used to add each string from the list to the builder, and the `build` method is called to transition the builder to the built state and return the resulting stream.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the builder has already transitioned to the built state for java.util.stream.Stream.Builder.build() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state before calling the `build` method. If the builder has already been built, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown:

```
public Stream<String> buildStream(List<String> list) {
    Stream.Builder<String> builder = Stream.builder();
    for (String s : list) {
        builder.add(s);
    }
    if (builder.build().isParallel()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Builder has already been built");
    }
    return builder.build();
}
```

In this updated version, we first call the `build` method to create the stream and then check if the stream is parallel using the `isParallel` method. If the stream is parallel, we assume that the builder has already been built and throw an `IllegalStateException`. Otherwise, we return the stream.

    }
}
```

In this updated version, we call the `build` method to create the stream and catch any `IllegalStateException` that may be thrown. If an exception is caught, we re-throw it with a more descriptive message. Otherwise, we return the stream.
