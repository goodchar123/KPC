Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the builder has already transitioned to the built state before calling the `build` method. If the builder has already been built, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown:

```
public Stream<String> buildStream(List<String> list) {
    Stream.Builder<String> builder = Stream.builder();
    for (String s : list) {
        builder.add(s);
    }
    try {
        return builder.build();
    } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Builder has already been built", e);
    }
}
```

In this updated version, we call the `build` method to create the stream and catch any `IllegalStateException` that may be thrown. If an exception is caught, we re-throw it with a more descriptive message. Otherwise, we return the stream.
