Sure, here's an updated version of the `handleFatalError()` method that checks if a security manager exists and its `checkExit()` method doesn't allow exit with the specified status:

```java
public void handleFatalError(Exception e) {
    // Log the error message
    System.err.println("Fatal error occurred: " + e.getMessage());

    // Send an email notification to the administrator
    sendEmailToAdmin("Fatal error occurred", e.getMessage());

    // Check if a security manager exists and its checkExit method doesn't allow exit with the specified status
    SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
    if (sm != null) {
        try {
            sm.checkExit(1);
        } catch (SecurityException se) {
            throw se;
        }
    }

    // Terminate the application
    System.exit(1);
}
```

This updated version first checks if a security manager exists by calling the `System.getSecurityManager()` method. If a security manager exists, it then calls its `checkExit()` method with the status code `1` to check if exit with the specified status is allowed. If the `checkExit()` method throws a `SecurityException`, the method re-throws it. Otherwise, the method terminates the application by calling the `System.exit()` method with a status code of `1`.

This additional check ensures that the application can only be terminated if the security manager allows it, which can help prevent unauthorized or accidental termination of the application.
