Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for I/O errors and socket connection before returning the output stream:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.Socket;

public class SocketHelper {
    public static OutputStream getOutputStream(Socket socket) throws IOException {
        if (socket == null || !socket.isConnected()) {
            throw new IOException("Socket is not connected");
        }
        
        OutputStream outputStream = null;
        try {
            outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new IOException("Error creating output stream", e);
        }
        
        return outputStream;
    }
}
```

This method first checks if the socket is null or not connected. If either of these conditions is true, it throws an `IOException` with an appropriate message. 

If the socket is connected, it tries to create an output stream using `socket.getOutputStream()`. If an `IOException` occurs during this process, it throws a new `IOException` with the original exception as the cause. 

Otherwise, it returns the output stream.
