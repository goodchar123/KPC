
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks for database access errors, closed connections, and unsupported methods:

```java
public int getStatementTimeout(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    try {
        int timeout = conn.getNetworkTimeout();
        if (timeout > 0) {
            return timeout / 1000;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLException("Database access error occurred", e);
        } else if (e.getErrorCode() == 17002) {
            throw new SQLException("Connection is closed", e);
        } else if (e.getErrorCode() == 0 && e.getSQLState().equals("S1C00")) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("Method not supported by JDBC driver", e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method now includes a try-catch block that catches any `SQLException` that may occur when calling the `getNetworkTimeout()` method. 

If the error code is 0, it means that a database access error occurred, so the method throws a new `SQLException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause. 

If the error code is 17002, it means that the connection is closed, so the method throws a new `SQLException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause. 

If the error code is 0 and the SQL state is "S1C00", it means that the JDBC driver does not support the `getNetworkTimeout()` method, so the method throws a new `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` with a custom error message and the original exception as the cause. 

If none of the above conditions are met, the method re-throws the original `SQLException`.
