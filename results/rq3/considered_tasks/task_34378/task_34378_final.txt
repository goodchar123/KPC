
Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the requested error checking:

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public class MidiOutConnection {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws MidiUnavailableException, InvalidMidiDataException {
        try {
            // Obtain a list of all MIDI devices
            MidiDevice.Info[] infos = MidiSystem.getMidiDeviceInfo();
            
            // Find the first MIDI device that is a transmitter
            MidiDevice transmitter = null;
            for (MidiDevice.Info info : infos) {
                MidiDevice device = MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(info);
                if (device instanceof Transmitter) {
                    transmitter = device;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (transmitter == null) {
                throw new MidiUnavailableException("No MIDI transmitter available");
            }
            
            // Open the transmitter and obtain its receiver
            try {
                transmitter.open();
            } catch (MidiUnavailableException e) {
                throw new MidiUnavailableException("MIDI device cannot be opened due to resource restrictions");
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("MIDI device cannot be opened due to security restrictions");
            }
            
            Receiver receiver = null;
            try {
                receiver = transmitter.getReceiver();
            } catch (MidiUnavailableException e) {
                throw new MidiUnavailableException("Receiver is not available due to resource restrictions");
            }
            
            if (receiver == null) {
                throw new MidiUnavailableException("No MIDI receiver available");
            }
            
            // Send some MIDI data through the receiver
            ShortMessage message = new ShortMessage();
            try {
                message.setMessage(ShortMessage.NOTE_ON, 0, 60, 93);
            } catch (InvalidMidiDataException e) {
                throw new InvalidMidiDataException("Invalid MIDI data");
            }
            
            try {
                receiver.send(message, -1);
            } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Receiver is closed");
            }
            
            // Close the transmitter and receiver
            transmitter.close();
            receiver.close();
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Info object does not represent a MIDI device installed on the system");
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Info is null");
        }
    }
}
```

This method includes error checking for various scenarios, such as when the requested device is not available due to resource restrictions, when the info object does not represent a MIDI device installed on the system, when info is null, when the device cannot be opened due to resource or security restrictions, when a receiver is not available due to resource restrictions, when the receiver is closed, and when the MIDI data is invalid.
