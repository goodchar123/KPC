Please write a java method that Obtains a MIDI OUT connection from which the MIDI device will transmit MIDI data.
Sure, here's an example Java method that obtains a MIDI OUT connection:

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public class MidiOutConnection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Obtain a list of all MIDI devices
            MidiDevice.Info[] infos = MidiSystem.getMidiDeviceInfo();
            
            // Find the first MIDI device that is a transmitter
            MidiDevice transmitter = null;
            for (MidiDevice.Info info : infos) {
                MidiDevice device = MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(info);
                if (device instanceof Transmitter) {
                    transmitter = device;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            // Open the transmitter and obtain its receiver
            transmitter.open();
            Receiver receiver = transmitter.getReceiver();
            
            // Send some MIDI data through the receiver
            ShortMessage message = new ShortMessage();
            message.setMessage(ShortMessage.NOTE_ON, 0, 60, 93);
            receiver.send(message, -1);
            
            // Close the transmitter and receiver
            transmitter.close();
            receiver.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This method obtains a list of all MIDI devices, finds the first device that is a transmitter, opens the transmitter and obtains its receiver, sends some MIDI data through the receiver, and then closes the transmitter and receiver. You can modify this method to suit your specific needs.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if the requested device is not available         due to resource restrictions for javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.Info) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw MidiUnavailableException.
Please check if the info object does not represent a         MIDI device installed on the system for javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.Info) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if info is null for javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.Info) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
Please check thrown if the device cannot be opened         due to resource restrictions for javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.open() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw MidiUnavailableException.
Please check thrown if the device cannot be opened due to         security restrictions for javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.open() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw SecurityException.
Please check thrown if a receiver is not available         due to resource restrictions for javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice.getReceiver() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw MidiUnavailableException.
Please check if the receiver is closed for javax.sound.midi.Receiver.send(javax.sound.midi.MidiMessage,long) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalStateException.
Please check if the status byte or all data bytes         belonging to the message, do not specify a valid MIDI message for javax.sound.midi.ShortMessage.setMessage(int,int,int,int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw InvalidMidiDataException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that includes the requested error checking:

```java
import javax.sound.midi.*;

public class MidiOutConnection {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws MidiUnavailableException, InvalidMidiDataException {
        try {
            // Obtain a list of all MIDI devices
            MidiDevice.Info[] infos = MidiSystem.getMidiDeviceInfo();
            
            // Find the first MIDI device that is a transmitter
            MidiDevice transmitter = null;
            for (MidiDevice.Info info : infos) {
                MidiDevice device = MidiSystem.getMidiDevice(info);
                if (device instanceof Transmitter) {
                    transmitter = device;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (transmitter == null) {
                throw new MidiUnavailableException("No MIDI transmitter available");
            }
            
            // Open the transmitter and obtain its receiver
            try {
                transmitter.open();
            } catch (MidiUnavailableException e) {
                throw new MidiUnavailableException("MIDI device cannot be opened due to resource restrictions");
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("MIDI device cannot be opened due to security restrictions");
            }
            
            Receiver receiver = null;
            try {
                receiver = transmitter.getReceiver();
            } catch (MidiUnavailableException e) {
                throw new MidiUnavailableException("Receiver is not available due to resource restrictions");
            }
            
            if (receiver == null) {
                throw new MidiUnavailableException("No MIDI receiver available");
            }
            
            // Send some MIDI data through the receiver
            ShortMessage message = new ShortMessage();
            try {
                message.setMessage(ShortMessage.NOTE_ON, 0, 60, 93);
            } catch (InvalidMidiDataException e) {
                throw new InvalidMidiDataException("Invalid MIDI data");
            }
            
            try {
                receiver.send(message, -1);
            } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Receiver is closed");
            }
            
            // Close the transmitter and receiver
            transmitter.close();
            receiver.close();
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Info object does not represent a MIDI device installed on the system");
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Info is null");
        }
    }
}
```

This method includes error checking for various scenarios, such as when the requested device is not available due to resource restrictions, when the info object does not represent a MIDI device installed on the system, when info is null, when the device cannot be opened due to resource or security restrictions, when a receiver is not available due to resource restrictions, when the receiver is closed, and when the MIDI data is invalid.
