Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
import javax.xml.xpath.*;
import org.xml.sax.InputSource;

public class XPathEvaluator {
    
    public static <T> T evaluateXPath(InputSource inputSource, String xpathExpression, QName returnType) throws XPathExpressionException {
        // Check if XPathFactory can be created
        try {
            XPathFactory xPathFactory = XPathFactory.newInstance();
        } catch (XPathFactoryConfigurationException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Failed to create XPathFactory for default object model", e);
        }
        
        // Check if expression is null
        if (xpathExpression == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("XPath expression cannot be null");
        }
        
        // Check if returnType is valid
        if (returnType != XPathConstants.NODESET && returnType != XPathConstants.BOOLEAN && returnType != XPathConstants.NUMBER && returnType != XPathConstants.STRING) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid returnType specified");
        }
        
        // Check if source or returnType is null
        if (inputSource == null || returnType == null) {
            throw new NullPointerException("InputSource and returnType cannot be null");
        }
        
        XPath xPath = xPathFactory.newXPath();
        XPathExpression xPathExpression = null;
        try {
            xPathExpression = xPath.compile(xpathExpression);
        } catch (XPathExpressionException e) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Failed to compile XPath expression", e);
        }
        Object result = xPathExpression.evaluate(inputSource, returnType);
        return (T) result;
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following error checking:

- If `XPathFactory.newInstance()` throws a `XPathFactoryConfigurationException`, a `RuntimeException` is thrown with a message indicating that the factory could not be created.
- If `xpathExpression` is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating that the expression cannot be null.
- If `returnType` is not one of the types defined in `XPathConstants`, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with a message indicating that the returnType is invalid.
- If `inputSource` or `returnType` is null, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating that these parameters cannot be null.
- If `xPath.compile()` throws a `XPathExpressionException`, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with a message indicating that the expression could not be compiled.

These checks ensure that the method is used correctly and that any errors are caught and reported in a meaningful way.
