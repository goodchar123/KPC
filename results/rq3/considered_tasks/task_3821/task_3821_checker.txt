List the fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the method above. Provide only name with parameters, no other text. Parameters must be fully qualified. Display in a list.
The fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the `XPathEvaluator` method are:

- `javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory.newInstance()`
- `javax.xml.xpath.XPath.compile(java.lang.String)`
- `javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource, javax.xml.namespace.QName)`

 + From response, we get: ['XPathEvaluator', 'javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory.newInstance()', 'javax.xml.xpath.XPath.compile(java.lang.String)', 'javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource,javax.xml.namespace.QName)']
------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPath.compile(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` thrown by `XPath.compile()` is not handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XPathExpressionException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource,javax.xml.namespace.QName) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `XPathExpressionException` thrown by `XPathExpression.evaluate()` is handled or caught in the `evaluateXPath()` method by the `throws XPathExpressionException` clause in the method signature.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IllegalArgumentException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource,javax.xml.namespace.QName) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IllegalArgumentException` thrown by `XPathExpression.evaluate()` is not handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource,javax.xml.namespace.QName) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.

The fully qualified name of the Java JDK methods used in the updated `XPathEvaluator` method are:

- `javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory.newInstance()`
- `javax.xml.xpath.XPath.compile(java.lang.String)`
- `javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource, javax.xml.namespace.QName)`

 + From response, we get: ['XPathEvaluator', 'javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory.newInstance()', 'javax.xml.xpath.XPath.compile(java.lang.String)', 'javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource,javax.xml.namespace.QName)']
------------------------------------------------------
Is the RuntimeException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory.newInstance() in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `RuntimeException` thrown by `XPathFactory.newInstance()` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is simply re-thrown with a custom message.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XPathExpressionException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPath.compile(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `XPathExpressionException` thrown by `XPath.compile()` is declared in the method signature and is therefore handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPath.compile(java.lang.String) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` that may be thrown by `XPath.compile()` if the `xpathExpression` parameter is null is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is simply allowed to propagate up the call stack.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the XPathExpressionException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource,javax.xml.namespace.QName) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
Yes. The `XPathExpressionException` thrown by `XPathExpression.evaluate()` is declared in the method signature and is therefore handled or caught in the code snippet.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the IllegalArgumentException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource,javax.xml.namespace.QName) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `IllegalArgumentException` that may be thrown by `XPathExpression.evaluate()` if the `returnType` parameter is not one of the types defined in `XPathConstants` is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is simply allowed to propagate up the call stack.
------------------------------------------------------
Is the NullPointerException handled or caught for javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression.evaluate(org.xml.sax.InputSource,javax.xml.namespace.QName) in the code snippet? Answer in Yes or No only.
No. The `NullPointerException` that may be thrown by `XPathExpression.evaluate()` if the `inputSource` or `returnType` parameter is null is not handled or caught in the code snippet. It is simply allowed to propagate up the call stack.
