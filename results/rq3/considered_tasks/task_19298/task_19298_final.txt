Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the error checking you requested:

```java
public void addBoundAddress(SocketChannel channel, InetAddress address) throws IOException, SecurityException, IllegalArgumentException {
    ServerSocket socket = channel.socket();
    try {
        socket.bind(new InetSocketAddress(address, socket.getLocalPort()));
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new IOException("Failed to bind socket to address: " + address, e);
    } catch (SecurityException e) {
        throw new SecurityException("Security manager doesn't allow the bind operation", e);
    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Endpoint is a SocketAddress subclass not supported by this socket", e);
    }
}
```

This updated method now includes error checking for the three scenarios you mentioned:

1. If the bind operation fails or if the socket is already bound, an `IOException` will be thrown with a message indicating the failure.
2. If a `SecurityManager` is present and its `checkListen` method doesn't allow the operation, a `SecurityException` will be thrown with a message indicating the failure.
3. If the endpoint is a `SocketAddress` subclass not supported by this socket, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown with a message indicating the failure.

By including these error checks, the method provides more robust handling of potential issues that may arise during the binding process.
