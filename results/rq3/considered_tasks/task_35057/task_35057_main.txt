Please write a java method that Gets the location of this component in the form of a point specifying the component's top-left corner in the screen's coordinate space.
Here's a Java method that gets the location of a component in the form of a point specifying the component's top-left corner in the screen's coordinate space:

```java
public Point getLocationOnScreen(Component component) {
    Point location = component.getLocationOnScreen();
    return location;
}
```

You can call this method by passing in the component whose location you want to get. The method will return a Point object that represents the component's top-left corner in the screen's coordinate space.

Please check if the          component is not showing on the screen for java.awt.Component.getLocationOnScreen() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalComponentStateException.
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the component is not showing on the screen for `java.awt.Component.getLocationOnScreen()` and throws an `IllegalComponentStateException` if that's the case:

```java
public Point getLocationOnScreen(Component component) throws IllegalComponentStateException {
    if (!component.isShowing()) {
        throw new IllegalComponentStateException("Component is not showing on the screen");
    }
    Point location = component.getLocationOnScreen();
    return location;
}
```

This updated method first checks if the component is showing on the screen using the `isShowing()` method. If the component is not showing, it throws an `IllegalComponentStateException` with a message indicating that the component is not showing on the screen. If the component is showing, it calls the `getLocationOnScreen()` method to get the component's location on the screen and returns the result as a `Point` object.
