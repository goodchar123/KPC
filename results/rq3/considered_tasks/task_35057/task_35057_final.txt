
Sure, here's the updated Java method that checks if the component is not showing on the screen for `java.awt.Component.getLocationOnScreen()` and throws an `IllegalComponentStateException` if that's the case:

```java
public Point getLocationOnScreen(Component component) throws IllegalComponentStateException {
    if (!component.isShowing()) {
        throw new IllegalComponentStateException("Component is not showing on the screen");
    }
    Point location = component.getLocationOnScreen();
    return location;
}
```

This updated method first checks if the component is showing on the screen using the `isShowing()` method. If the component is not showing, it throws an `IllegalComponentStateException` with a message indicating that the component is not showing on the screen. If the component is showing, it calls the `getLocationOnScreen()` method to get the component's location on the screen and returns the result as a `Point` object.
