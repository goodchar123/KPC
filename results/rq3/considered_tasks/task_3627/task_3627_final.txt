Sure, here's an updated version of the method that checks if the current state allows attribute writing before calling the `writeAttribute` method. If the current state does not allow attribute writing, it throws an `IllegalStateException`:

```java
public void writeAttributeWithoutPrefix(String attributeName, String attributeValue, XMLStreamWriter writer) throws XMLStreamException {
    if (writer.getEventType() != XMLStreamWriter.START_ELEMENT) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot write attribute in current state");
    }
    writer.writeAttribute(attributeName, attributeValue);
}
```

This updated method first checks the current event type of the XMLStreamWriter object using the `getEventType` method. If the current event type is not `START_ELEMENT`, it means that the current state does not allow attribute writing, so it throws an `IllegalStateException`. Otherwise, it calls the `writeAttribute` method to write the attribute to the output stream.

Note that this method may still throw an `XMLStreamException` if there is an error writing to the output stream. You may want to handle this exception in your code.
