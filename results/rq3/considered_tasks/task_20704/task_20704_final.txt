
Here's the updated Java method that includes error handling for the cases you mentioned:

```java
public static void truncateClob(Clob clob, long len) throws SQLException {
    try {
        if (clob.length() > len) {
            clob.truncate(len);
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        if (e.getErrorCode() == 0) {
            throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("The JDBC driver does not support the length() method for CLOB objects.");
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    } catch (AbstractMethodError e) {
        throw new SQLFeatureNotSupportedException("The JDBC driver does not support the truncate() method for CLOB objects.");
    }
}
```

This updated method includes a try-catch block to handle potential errors when accessing the length of the CLOB value or calling the `truncate()` method. 

If the `length()` method is not supported by the JDBC driver, a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown with an appropriate message. If any other SQLException is thrown, it is re-thrown to the calling method.

If the `truncate()` method is not supported by the JDBC driver, an `AbstractMethodError` is thrown, and a `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` is thrown with an appropriate message.
