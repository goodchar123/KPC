Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that includes the requested error checking:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class TaskScheduler {
    public static void scheduleTask(Runnable task, long delay) {
        if (task == null || delay < 0) {
            throw new NullPointerException("Task or delay cannot be null or negative");
        }
        
        ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
        try {
            executor.schedule(task, delay, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
        } catch (RejectedExecutionException e) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task cannot be scheduled for execution", e);
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown();
            try {
                executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            } catch (SecurityException e) {
                throw new SecurityException("Shutting down ExecutorService may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This updated method includes the following error checking:

- If the `task` parameter is null or the `delay` parameter is negative, a `NullPointerException` is thrown with an appropriate error message.
- If the task cannot be scheduled for execution, a `RejectedExecutionException` is thrown with an appropriate error message.
- If a security manager exists and shutting down the `ExecutorService` may manipulate threads that the caller is not permitted to modify, a `SecurityException` is thrown with an appropriate error message.

The `finally` block ensures that the `ExecutorService` is always shut down, even if an exception is thrown. The `executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)` method waits for up to 1 second for the `ExecutorService` to shut down gracefully. If the `ExecutorService` does not shut down within this time, a `InterruptedException` is thrown and the current thread is interrupted.

You can call this updated method in the same way as before, and it will now perform additional error checking to ensure that the task is scheduled and executed correctly.
