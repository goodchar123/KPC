Sure, here's the updated code snippet that checks if access is denied and throws a `SecurityException` if necessary:

```
import java.security.*;

public class MyGuard implements Guard {
    private final Permission permission;

    public MyGuard(Permission permission) {
        this.permission = permission;
    }

    @Override
    public void checkGuard(Object object) throws SecurityException {
        if (!permission.implies((Permission) object)) {
            throw new SecurityException("Access denied");
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated implementation, the `checkGuard` method checks if the permission implies the object being guarded. If the permission does not imply the object, a `SecurityException` is thrown with the message "Access denied". This ensures that access is denied if the permission is not granted.
