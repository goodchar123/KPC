Please write a java method that Returns the next node in the set and advances the position of the NodeIterator in the set.
Here's an example Java method that returns the next node in the set and advances the position of the NodeIterator:

```java
public Node getNextNode(NodeIterator nodeIterator) {
    if (nodeIterator.hasNext()) {
        return nodeIterator.nextNode();
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

This method takes a NodeIterator as a parameter and checks if there is a next node in the set using the `hasNext()` method. If there is a next node, it returns that node using the `nextNode()` method. If there is no next node, it returns null. The `nextNode()` method also advances the position of the NodeIterator in the set.

Please check INVALID_STATE_ERR: Raised if this method is called after the   detach method was invoked. for org.w3c.dom.traversal.NodeIterator.nextNode() in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw DOMException.
Sure, here's an updated version of the Java method that checks for the `INVALID_STATE_ERR` exception and throws a `DOMException` if it occurs:

```java
public Node getNextNode(NodeIterator nodeIterator) throws DOMException {
    try {
        if (nodeIterator.hasNext()) {
            return nodeIterator.nextNode();
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    } catch (DOMException e) {
        if (e.code == DOMException.INVALID_STATE_ERR) {
            throw e;
        } else {
            throw new DOMException(DOMException.NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR, "Error getting next node");
        }
    }
}
```

This method now includes a try-catch block that catches any `DOMException` thrown by the `nextNode()` method. If the exception code is `INVALID_STATE_ERR`, it is re-thrown. Otherwise, a new `DOMException` is thrown with a code of `NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR` and a message of "Error getting next node". This ensures that the method complies with the specification for the `nextNode()` method in the `NodeIterator` interface.
