Please write a java method that Creates a thread pool that maintains enough threads to support the given parallelism level, and may use multiple queues to reduce contention.
Here's an example Java method that creates a thread pool with a given parallelism level and multiple queues to reduce contention:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static ExecutorService createThreadPool(int parallelism) {
        // Create a thread pool with a fixed number of threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(parallelism);
        
        // Create multiple queues to reduce contention
        BlockingQueue<Runnable>[] queues = new BlockingQueue[parallelism];
        for (int i = 0; i < parallelism; i++) {
            queues[i] = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
        }
        
        // Create a custom thread factory that assigns tasks to queues in a round-robin fashion
        ThreadFactory factory = new ThreadFactory() {
            private int index = 0;
            
            public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
                int i = index++ % parallelism;
                return new Thread(queues[i].offer(r) ? null : r);
            }
        };
        
        // Set the custom thread factory for the thread pool
        ((ThreadPoolExecutor) executor).setThreadFactory(factory);
        
        return executor;
    }
}
```

This method creates a fixed thread pool with a given parallelism level, and then creates multiple queues to reduce contention among the threads. It also creates a custom thread factory that assigns tasks to the queues in a round-robin fashion, so that each queue gets an equal share of the workload. Finally, it sets the custom thread factory for the thread pool and returns the executor service.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if nThreads <= 0 for java.util.concurrent.Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if threadFactory is null for java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.setThreadFactory(java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
You are correct, it is important to add those checks to ensure the method is robust. Here's the updated code snippet with the checks:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static ExecutorService createThreadPool(int parallelism) {
        if (parallelism <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("parallelism must be greater than 0");
        }
        
        // Create a thread pool with a fixed number of threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(parallelism);
        
        // Create multiple queues to reduce contention
        BlockingQueue<Runnable>[] queues = new BlockingQueue[parallelism];
        for (int i = 0; i < parallelism; i++) {
            queues[i] = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
        }
        
        // Create a custom thread factory that assigns tasks to queues in a round-robin fashion
        ThreadFactory factory = new ThreadFactory() {
            private int index = 0;
            
            public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
                int i = index++ % parallelism;
                return new Thread(queues[i].offer(r) ? null : r);
            }
        };
        
        // Set the custom thread factory for the thread pool
        if (((ThreadPoolExecutor) executor).getThreadFactory() == null) {
            ((ThreadPoolExecutor) executor).setThreadFactory(factory);
        } else {
            throw new NullPointerException("threadFactory cannot be null");
        }
        
        return executor;
    }
}
```

Now, if the `parallelism` parameter is less than or equal to 0, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown. Similarly, if the thread factory is null when setting it for the thread pool, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown.
------------------------------------------------------
Please check if nThreads <= 0 for java.util.concurrent.Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw IllegalArgumentException.
Please check if threadFactory is null for java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.setThreadFactory(java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory) in the code snippet you provided, otherwise throw NullPointerException.
You are correct, it is important to add those checks to ensure the method is robust. Here's the updated code snippet with the checks:

        }
        
        // Create a thread pool with a fixed number of threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(parallelism);
        
        // Create multiple queues to reduce contention
        BlockingQueue<Runnable>[] queues = new BlockingQueue[parallelism];
        for (int i = 0; i < parallelism; i++) {
            queues[i] = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
        }
        
        // Create a custom thread factory that assigns tasks to queues in a round-robin fashion
        ThreadFactory factory = new ThreadFactory() {
            private int index = 0;
            
            public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
                int i = index++ % parallelism;
                return new Thread(queues[i].offer(r) ? null : r);
            }
        };
        
        // Set the custom thread factory for the thread pool
        if (((ThreadPoolExecutor) executor).getThreadFactory() == null) {
            ((ThreadPoolExecutor) executor).setThreadFactory(factory);
        } else {
            throw new NullPointerException("threadFactory cannot be null");
        }
        
        return executor;
    }
}
```
