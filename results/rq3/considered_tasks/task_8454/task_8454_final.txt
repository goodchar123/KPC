You are correct, it is important to add those checks to ensure the method is robust. Here's the updated code snippet with the checks:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static ExecutorService createThreadPool(int parallelism) {
        if (parallelism <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("parallelism must be greater than 0");
        }
        
        // Create a thread pool with a fixed number of threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(parallelism);
        
        // Create multiple queues to reduce contention
        BlockingQueue<Runnable>[] queues = new BlockingQueue[parallelism];
        for (int i = 0; i < parallelism; i++) {
            queues[i] = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
        }
        
        // Create a custom thread factory that assigns tasks to queues in a round-robin fashion
        ThreadFactory factory = new ThreadFactory() {
            private int index = 0;
            
            public Thread newThread(Runnable
